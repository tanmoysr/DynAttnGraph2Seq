Also, if the path report does not show complete \"margins\" meaning enough of the muscle was taken to be sure it has not invaded further, a second TURB is often done.

I am just sorry for the reason to be here and just wanted to reassure you your post is being seen. From your question I presume you are now being treated for bladder cancer after prostate cancer?\n\nI don't recall anyone who has gone the same set of circumstances so let's hope someone will have additional insight. If you are passing blood BCG should not be instilled as it could crossover into the blood stream. So, you may have to wait another period to get the clear. The good news is most tumors do not grow that fast so another 2 weeks probably won't make much difference. Keep asking away as questions come up. Someone should be around with a \"been there and done that\".\t\t\t", "date": "2020-01-18T19:35:26+00:00", "topic": "Bladder cancer treatments after proton radiation for Prostate cancer 8 years ago", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tWelcome activebladder!\n\nGlad you found us but, we're sorry for the why. The process will complete usually not as fast most of us like however, you are taking steps to resolve the question. Most likely you will have a cystoscope to look inside the bladder. If you are a male the prostate sometimes makes this \"uncomfortable\" to me for a few seconds...maybe 15-25 seconds and some say painful but, it is over with in a short time. That will help your URO determine the next steps. usually that will involve a TURB (transurethral resection of the bladder) which a fancy description of a short day surgery to burn and cutaway the growth and send specimens to pathology. You will not know anything until they have a chance to grade and examine it. Waiting is the hardest part and it does no good to conjecture as rarely, these things are not even cancer. You may also be given a CT Scan of your torso to make sure the rest of the urinary tract is clear. In the meantime, feel free to browse around this web site and ask away with other questions as you go. Everyone here are volunteers and many will chime in with other thoughts as you go.\n\nLast quick note. Be sure to get a URO that does see a lot of bladder cancer as so many handle mostly prostate issues. If you are close to a major cancer center, I'd even start there such as MD Anderson (Houston), Cleveland Clinic, Northwestern U, John Hopkins, USC to name a few.

The important item is you want a URO that sees a lot of BC whereas so many treat mostly prostate issues. The skill in the TURB is important to be sure \"margins\" are proper for a complete diagnosis. IF a first with pathology indicates a high grade tumor a second is often done to confirm \"margins\" to be safe. There  is always a possibility of a growth that is NOT cancer to answer directly about being benign. After that your pathology will be the important piece of your treatment plan. Low grade is often \"watching and waiting\" meaning you will see your Uro every 3 months as a general rule for a year or two. High grade usually means treatment with BCG with is immunotherapy. Please peruse this web site for generalities on this. Also very important the TURB hopefully will show no muscle involvement as that often involves a cystectomy to prevent any spreading of the cancer.\n\nLet's not get ahead of ourselves. Waiting is the worst part. The TURB and pathology are the next piece of your puzzle and DX.

Low grade and no muscle involvement and you will probably be given cysto scope every 3 months for a year or two graduating to every 6 months and finally a year.

Yes, your symptoms are usually not indicative of bladder cancer. The reason why your URO probably hasn't done more bladder tests per above the usual tests are twofold. First, both are invasive meaning there is some risks involved with each albeit they are small. The CT Scan with contrast dye reading your torso does add a lot of radiation and the dye for a few can cause complications. The cystoscopy likewise can invite UTI's and for a few abrasions and strictures etc of the urethra. This not mentioned to alarm you, just possibly explaining your doc's thought process. As Jack said the blood dipstick and a urine cytology (there are false positives as a small problem) are non invasive and can give some important clues on whether to go with more tests.

As mentioned, he wanted to minimize invasive testing and procedures as much as possible although I had 2 TURBS and 12 BCG installations. After a year of cystos every 3 months he jumped me to one every 6 months for a year then yearly after. It may have to be more with my tumor being small. Between my GP and URO we concocted spacing 6 months between my annual physical and my yearly cysto with cytology for each being a non invasive test.\n\nAs for BCG. I have read about VERY few systemic problems. Should I have had an infection or any continued bleeding he would have waited to do the next installation. Every one seems to react slightly different in side effects with most being cumulative. For me the first 4 or so were a breeze, 5 and 6 caused fatigue and some minor bleeding. The next group of 6 added more mild pain, burning when voiding and more fatigue. The fatigue might have been more to do with less sleep getting up 12-15 times at night. Drink lots of water! The biggest problem was the 24-36 hours after an installation. I learned to know where the nearest restroom was because I had maybe 20-30 seconds otherwise I would have no control. 2 days after it was better having maybe 5 minutes to know where to go-it got to be humorous! For these reasons I tried to have mine done later in the day so I would have maybe one bad day. After the total of 12 I think I was pretty much back to normal a few weeks later.

Your doctor while young is doing what most on this board would recommend and is the standard of care which is a second TURB (transuretal re=section) to biopsy again. What they are looking for is to be sure the tumor hasn't invaded the muscle (Stage 2). Stage 3 is deeper to the baldder edge and Stage 4 means it has spread. This is because many initial TURBs are understaged.\n\nSize and number of tumors are also part of what you need to know.\n\nQuestions to ask your URO: how many bladder cancer patients does he see and treat each month. I would want to have him say at least 20+. Many, for obvious reasion treat far more prostate patients and with your prior DX of prostate cancer it makes you more at risk. Most would also tell you to get to a major bladder cancer center because of all above. Some that know more about the Carolina's should have a good refernce point for a major bladder cancer hospital.

I saved this list from somewhere else (not my work) but, it is a great list and I saved it should I or someone else need this someday.\n\nSome good questions to ask for those newly diagnosed with invasive bladder cancer and considering cystectomy.\nPre Op Questions\n\nWhich technique would you recommend under ideal conditions*, how many times have you done it?\nIf female, how many women have you operated on using this procedure?\nIf male, is removal of the prostate necessary? If so, what results have you had with nerve sparing procedures?\nCan the first stage of a 3 piece inflatable prosthesis be implanted during the surgery - the reservoir and pump? (helps to do it then - cylinders can go in thru small incision and be connected later)\nExplain exactly what you will be doing (different for Kock, Indiana, neobladder, external).\nHow much intestine will be used?  Will it involve the terminal ileum and cecal valve? (without the cecal valve, bacteria from the large intestine can reflux into the small intestine causing diarrhea)\nWhat results have you had re:continence after surgery. What about hypercontinence?\nCan you put me in contact with other patients to talk with about the procedure? Support group? Counselling?\nCan I donate blood in advance?\nAre you amenable to drug resistance tests and complying with live path specimen shipment and handling procedures during/after surgery (in case chemo is required down the road)?\nHow long does the surgery last? How long will I be in intensive care?\nWhat's the average hospital stay? What is the average recovery period?\nHow many catheters will I wake up with, and how long will they stay in. Will there be an NG tube? For how long?\nMay I have the name of the anesthesiologist? (it's a good idea to discuss things before surgery)\nDoes the hospital have an ET nurse or an experienced staff?\nWhat kind of pain medication is available for me post op? How will it be administered? What kind of pain medication will I go home with? How can I counteract the side effects of pain meds? (constipation)\nWhat kind of supplies will I need when I get home and where do I buy them?\nWhat antibiotics will I be given?\nWhat should I do for diarrhea? (sometimes it helps to eliminate dairy products for a few weeks)\nWhat are some of the complications that can occur during surgery?\nWhat are some complications that can occur after surgery?\nWhat are some of the long-term after effects of the surgery and how would these be dealt with? (possible neuropathy, impotence)\nWhat are the long term effects of intestines holding urine, does the body adjust?\nWhat are the long term implications for other organs, specifically kidneys?\nCan you/will you check for colorectal cancer as well?\nWhat assurances/odds are there given the stage/grade that surgery alone will be a successful therapy?\nIf positive nodes or signs of mets are found, will surgery be carried out?\nAt my stage and grade, do I have other options? Would a clinical trial be appropriate?\nPost Op Questions\nHow soon after surgery will the pathology report be available? Will there be any biomarkers tested such as p53, p21, Ki67?\nWhat kind of help will I need upon return home (Home health aid? Visiting nurse?), and for approximately how long?\nHow long will the neobladder continue to produce mucous?\nCan I resume a normal lifestyle, including activities (depends on type of surgery..No contact sports, usually)?\nIf no spread is found, what is your planned course for follow up after surgery?\nWhat would be my treatment options if there are signs of spread?\nIf a course of chemo is required, how long after the surgery do we begin? Can I talk with folks on chemo?\nIf female, have them explain the instant menopause or put you in touch with someone who can. This is further complicated if chemo is required because you can't tell the meno hot flash from a chemo hot flash...\nWhat are your feelings on the subject of complimentary/alternative medicine and would you be amenable if I sought out such treamtent? What kind of dietary changes, if any, will I need to make?\nHow often should you have a specific Vitamin B12 test run? (the routine B12 catches only 75%)\nWhere can I order a medic-alert bracelet? This is advised for those with internal reservoirs which need intermittent catheterization. Some examples: 'continent urinary diversion'; 'continent urostomy must insert catheter to drain'; Continent Diversion, stoma location, cath #14, q2-3 hr; 'continent urinary reservoir via stoma'; 'continent urostomy needs 16 fr catheter every 4 hours'.\n*A preferred technique may be agreed upon in advance as the 'ideal' choice, however often times a person's anatomy can prohibit the creation of the preferred continent reservoir, and there is no real way to be sure until the surgeon looks inside.\t\t\t", "date": "2010-06-18T22:56:33+00:00", "topic": "Relief!!!

But for patients who had multiple CT scans, the increase in risk was higher, ranging from 2.7% to 12%.\" Is my math correct as I read 0.7% increase above a baseline of 42% of people having cancer and 2.7% to 12% above the 42%?

As you have had 2 there may be some reason why your URO picked gemcitabine wrapped into this. It could be that practice is still having trouble getting BCG? Perhaps they have had more success with it. Is there a medical or pathological reason why it was chosen? BCG is usually not given in a first DX of low grade so there may be a clue. Yes, I would have questions about it also.\n\nThe biggest difference is one agent is a chemo wash where the other (BCG) is immunotherapy done to rev your system up. Do you have an immune system issue or past TB diagnosis or other health issues? That could be a decision factor.\n\nFrom past reading from other posters and studies I have seen it does appear BCG is prefered with slightly better results. That does not mean that gemcitabine is not effective...there are posters that have had good results with this.\n\nI hope I haven't confused the issue.

While there are protocols for attacking bladder cancer, everyone is an individual and many have been given different/specialized treatments. I wouldn't get to hung up on a flow chart. My own URO, who studied under Dr. Lamm (who is now in AZ as BCG SWOG) in San Antonio at UTSA some 35+ years ago had me do a weekly induction over 6 weeks, 6 off then repeated. That was it. I have read MANY different approaches. Mine possibly was different due to the early detection and small tumor. I never asked the doctor why but, I know his philosophy is to do the least invasive treatments as possible with the highest probability to work. For example, cystoscopy is an integral and vital test. It still carries a small risk of added infections, scarring among other possibilities and he moved me to 6 months after a year with my OK. The norm is 2 years of 3 month exams. I believe he liked the 6 and 6 of BCG because the longer one extends this induction the greater increase of BCG itis, exposure to infections and again issues with the urethra besides the bladder.\n\nA few things are certain. BCG does work for the majority. Repeat TURBs are a good decision for most especially on high grade tumors. Continued follow up every 3 months extending to 6 and then yearly are important.

It would take 12-24 hours to really flush out the BCG of my system. I just kept telling myself it WILL pass and this is a LOT easier than CHEMO. Eating was not an issue.\n\nMy URO had me do another group after a 6 week wait. The last 3 or 4 I wasn't able to hold more than 60-90 minutes. The last maybe 30 minutes. Drink lots of water to flush your bladder every time. Almost as much as you can stand. I had read that rotating 90 degrees every 15 minutes for the 2 hours is good. Front, side, back, other side. On that subject my URO laughed and said the bladder is a small muscle when empty and that it shouldn't matter that it will fill. I rotated anyway figuring it couldn't hurt (visualize a broiled chicken for laughs). I tried to have mine done in the AM so I could work the next day. It worked for the most part but, even then the urge would hit sometimes so I always knew where the nearest restroom was (traveling salesman) or was prepared to simply do my duty by the roadside.\n\nIs this any fun? No, but very doable. I figure it took me a couple of weeks to get back to normal after my last 6. I just didn't drink anything an hour or two prior to the installations so I would be empty.\t\t\t", "date": "2017-01-16T13:08:21+00:00", "topic": "When to stop eating or drinking before BCG", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tDave,\n\nThanks for your post.

I have copied and pasted part of his site: \"BCG and Bladder Cancer\nWhile BCG is recognized as the most effective treatment for superficial bladder cancer (bladder cancer not invading the muscular wall of the bladder), it is not necessarily best for every patient. BCG can on rare occasion produce serious side effects. Low grade tumors that grow as a polyp (mushroom shape) in the bladder and have no invasion at all are at low risk for progression. Even a small treatment risk, therefore, can be avoided. In these patients intravesical chemotherapy, typically using just a single instillation at the time of surgery, is recommended.\nWhen tumors recur despite chemotherapy, when they are not low grade, and when they have superficial invasion or associated carcinoma in situ, BCG is generally indicated.\"\n\nIndeed, low grade is often a \"waiting and watching\" event. The item that most of us would encourage is a second opinion which it appears you have done and with a specialist that evidently does mostly BC. Mine was high and basically had no option. If it was low grade my URO was ready to \"wait and watch\" like your second opinion. He studied under Dr. Lamm. Also, not alarm you but, every procedure has risks including BCG that can cause tuberculosis. Cystoscopes carry a small risk. In my case I have to have strong antibiotics after for a day due to stirring up some nasty germs. Hope I haven't confused the issue. Perhaps some posters with low grade can chime in.\t\t\t", "date": "2012-09-16T18:30:29+00:00", "topic": "To BCG or not?", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\t15MM while small still needs a second opinion to properly stage and grade the tumor.

My URO put me on 6 weeks, 6 off then a follow up of 6 weeks and that is it. He reasoning was everytime you cath with BCG there is an increasing chance of problems, infections etc. Do as much as you can to stop things and stop. Who really knows? Everyone's situation is different. My tumor while high grade was tiny- .5 CM, caught early and cut out and after almost 3 years free it appears that is what has saved me from further problems. I still get a scope every 6 months going to go to a year after this one coming up. Again, this is accelerated because most suggest 6 months until the end of the 4th year. However, my annual physical (non BLC) will be set 6 months in between my future annual scopes to where I will still have cytology done which does have a greater efficacy on high grade tumors. Being a non invasive test this makes sense to me. This will give me some peace of mind and a check every 6 months instead just a 1 year cytology and scope.\n\nKim, all I can say is read as much as you can about this disease and be a good listener to your own body.

I also still accept everyone is still different. How's that for wishy washy statement!\n\nAnyway, mine was a papillary tumor also. It was small.5CM. My URO also did a second TURB to be sure on the margins. He is going by the basic playbook. He was stunned when the path report came back grade 3. Eyeball he was almost certain it was G1. Thus, the re-TURB. It did read stage 1-lamina propria-no muscle.\n\nI have done BCG, one group of 6 then a cysto 6 weeks later, with a follow up group of 6. Have had 3 cystos since all clear and clear cytology. There are several protocols with differing reasons for what a URO will do. My URO was actually at UTSA when Dr. Lamm pioneered the BCG. A very few say do one protocol of 6 and your done. A few (from what I have read from our Canadian friends some are on a monthly for a year). A bigger minority have done the 6 and 6 as mine. A bigger group like the 6 plus maintenence as per Dr. Lamm.\n\nLots of reason for the differing protocols. My URO talks about everytime he does a cysto there are some small risks. My last cysto activated latent bacteria or injected bacteria as I had to take antibiotics for an infection. BCG involves small risk-probably increasing with every instillation. Thus his group doing 6 and 6. I am currently clear a year.\n\nI am linking a Journal of Urology article-you can activate in as a guest. After 2 years the general consensus was maintenence vs. 6 and 6 was about equal. Who really knows? Our bodies are all different and I can find opposite abstracts from on almost every subject on cancer. See:\n\nEditorial Comment: The original regimen for treating urothelial cancer with intravesical BCG instillation was based simply on packaging, since 6 ampules of BCG were provided and the number of weekly instillations was therefore set at 6. Studies documenting the development of an immune response with intravesical BCG suggested that a maintenance regimen might be of value in maintaining prophylaxis, since recurrence and progression occurred notwithstanding promising responses to an initial 6-week instillation. The production of cytokines and lymphokines as well as the induction of T helper cells were enhanced by a 3-weekly \u201cbooster\u201d instillation 6 weeks after the last of the 6-week primary course. However, others demonstrated that a monthly instillation maintenance regimen was also effective in preventing recurrence.\n\nThe present study documented maximization of a peripheral immune response at 4 weekly instillations to maximize an immune response in those not previously immunized. However, the lymphoproliferative response was assessed in a relatively small number of patients, and it is known that lymphokine and cytokine production may have different patterns of response in terms of time course and dosage. Therefore, more patients will need to be studied and their tumor response to intravesical BCG assessed in relation to their lymphoproliferative response to determine appropriate regimens for BCG treatment. Much remains to be done to determine appropriate regimens and mechanisms such that treatments may be given based on specific reactivities of particular tumors in individual patients.\n\nSee for the complete: www.jurology.com/article/PIIS0022534705667936/fulltext ", "date": "2009-05-07T21:10:43+00:00", "topic": "Markers or grades or levels", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tMy URO doesn't have a monitor.

See:\nwww.jurology.com/article/PIIS0022534705667936/fulltext.\n\nHere's the body:A recent study by the Southwest Oncology group suggested a 3-week booster schedule to be effective in reducing tumor recurrence in high risk patients and protecting from disease progression. Considering the 7-year followup, recurrence was reduced by half (from 52% to 25%) with maximal benefit in patients with rapidly recurring tumors. The apparent advantage of this regimen in reducing disease progression did not appear to manifest until 2 years after induction was completed. However, in accessing results for all tumor patients receiving maintenance BCG versus those receiving no maintenance, differences were not particularly striking. For example, in examining maintenance treatment for stages Ta and T1 tumors versus controls, there is an early decrease in the control group at the 2.5 to 3 year interval before and following which the slopes of tumor-free status appear to be similar for both groups. Furthermore, in assessing maintenance therapy for carcinoma in situ, there is an early decrease in recurrence-free status (or persistence) in the \u201cno maintenance\u201d group until the 2-year interval when rates of tumor recurrence become similar between the 2 groups. Considering the heterogeneity of tumor responsiveness, host factors and variability of immune reactivity much remains to be determined in optimizing treatments with BCG to determine whether disease recurrence or progression can be prevented.\t\t\t", "date": "2009-03-19T23:33:07+00:00", "topic": "More BCG questions", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tDid I read 22 different types of meds? 20 prescriptions.

With a MIL that has some mental challenges it is even more complex. Please do give yourself a pat on the back for being a caring person! It is often more difficult on the caregiver than patient.\n\nAfter the usual diagnostic tests: cytology, Ct Scan and cystoscope I'll never forget the call from my URO after the pathology report. He was very caring and sensitive as he called my wife first who worked as an RN in the maternity ward at the same local hospital he had privileges at. It was high grade and he asked her if she wanted to break the news. She said no, he is a big boy and wants to hear it personally. I am grateful to both people! Anyway, it hit me like a ton of bricks. I was lucky, I had already researched several options on what if's plus I did not have to have a cystectomy. As it was non invasive I came to the quick realization BCG and non invasive was better than invasive. I also told myself even if it gets worse or BCG didn't work I knew MANY people with worse health problems. This took the better part of only a day. I had it, let's go on and attack! Some people are never even able to get to grips like this for which I am thankful for in my case. Not judging anyone as everyone has different histories, backgrounds, family situations etc. So, you probably have an idea on how to present this to your MIL already. I don't mean to write a book but, you are doing your best and that is all anyone can ask for.\n\nAge 79 also presents other problems as cystectomies are rigorous surgeries. How is her general health other than dementia? What does/will the doctor say? You sound like you are really researching things. One last observation. One simply does not know enough facts until the pathology report is done. Let's hope for the best (no surgery...maybe even it is NOT cancer as unlikely that is the case) and plan for whatever comes down the road. Also, a second TURB is usually done when there are not margins\" to evaluate the sample.\n\nContinue asking questions as others should see your post as you go. You do have some time to sort things out. IF, it becomes a surgery option I am attaching a pre-op guide that has too many questions so pick and choose as you see fit.\t\t\t", "date": "2019-09-28T14:10:27+00:00", "topic": "Learning you have cancer", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tEggie, welcome.\n\nJust wanted to acknowledge your post.

Either way it might be a good question to ask before you take your first treatment because of your stricture. Also, from what I remember, the actual installation was less \"uncomfortable\" itself than the cystoscopy. I had to remind myself both procedures would be over quickly after the prostate is passed the discomfort might have been 30 seconds. Also, I reminded myself that this is a lot less invasive and more tolerable than systemic chemo.\n\nBCG does have side effects from possible spasms, urgency, burning, fatigues, bleeding etc. Those symptoms do seem to appear when it is more successful and become cumulative. This is all doable and beatable.\n\nThere are also some meds that your doc can prescribe to possibly help. As I did not use those there are others that might chime in here as I simply never memorized them. Pyridium is one? Simple drugs like tylenol might help. Drink lots of water to flush this stuff out once your 2 hours are up. I even tried starting water 1/2 way so it would start filling te system....experiment. Ask away as you go.

They may have been concerned with other internal issues such as kidney stones, cancer of the kidney among many other internal problems. Sometimes a \"papillary\" mushroom like tumor will be picked up on a CT Scan. There is also a flat (called CIS) rash like tumor that cant be seen. IF they saw a papillary like stalk it MAY or NOT be cancer. There are other types of growths. The ER doctor may have simply wanted to prepare you for the cancer possibility. You won't really know much until the scope and if that is found a biopsy will be scheduled called a TURB (transurethral resection of the bladder). Usually it is a short surgery under anesthesia with a biopsy done with results usually in 4-10 days. So, you really won't know much until then.

The cells are then sent to Tengions manufacturing facility where they are grown in culture and then seeded onto a biodegradable scaffold in the shape of a bladder.\n\nThen, the patient returns to hospital and the urologist will implant the neo-bladder construct in a procedure known as augmentation cystoplasty or bladder augmentation.\n\nThe neo-bladder is expected to continue to regenerate within the patient, using the bodys inherent regenerative capabilities, and if successful may result in improved bladder function, Dr. Shenot noted.\n\nThe field of regenerative medicine is anticipated to be an area of intense interest and expansion in the coming years, said Dr. Shenot.\n\nWhile this first trial in adults is for pat\n\n\n\nContact: Jeff Baxt\nThis email address is being protected from spambots.
