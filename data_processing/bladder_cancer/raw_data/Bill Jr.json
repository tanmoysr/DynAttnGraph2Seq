Also seems like if a family member is a doctor that they would advise you to do the same thing we keep advising.  Also seems like they should be able to handle themselves in a situation where crappy doctors try to cause an issue over you getting better medical treatment.\n\nIf it is a prostate infection, you should ask about Levaquin for a 30 day dose.  It takes a LONG time of antibiotics to get rid of a prostate infection.\n\nIf the prostate still causes issues with the catheter, then inquire about getting a TUIP.  They make an incision in the prostate to loosen it up in the area of you urethra.  It's a pretty common surgery for enlarged prostate, which may be a contributing factor in addition to the infection.\n\nYou REALLY, REALLY, REALLY want to continue the BCG if at all possible.  While I've got a neobladder and am doing fine with it, I can tell you without a doubt that I would have rather been able to take the BCG treatments and still have a bladder.\n\nFinally, you can even go down to a 1/10th dose.  Dr. Lamm says there is no evidence of reduced efficacy even with that dose.  Send him a note to ask on his web site.\n\nAll we can do is advise based on what we know.

They will not use a smaller, as they say it interfers with the admin of the BCG.\n\nAnyway, to day I had my yearly with my GP.  The Uro had not notified him of my cancer.  Anyway, he did an in-office \"urine\" test, which indicated a infection.
