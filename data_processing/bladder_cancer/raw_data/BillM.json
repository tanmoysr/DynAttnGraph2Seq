Once you get a handle on this you\u2019ll need to become your own patient advocate and push for answers. Also, with this cancer, get second opinions. If it is T2, it can be very treatable. Your doc should have told you what grade the cancer is along with it being invasive T2.\n\nIf you have any questions or need opinions concerning doctors or hospitals, ask. Pat can give you information on all the experts and where to find it. All of us here have been through this.

The first one is to clean everything out and the second for tissue samples used for staging. Most imaging will only catch bigger masses, cancer cells that stray away from the main tumor are missed and they are the ones to worry about. Under staging is a big problem as TURBT\u2019s only gives a small picture of what the cancer is doing. There will probably be another TURBT for final staging as it sounds like your husband has only had one done so far.\n\nDr Wilson\u2019s staff is pretty efficient getting the information she will need, so don\u2019t worry about that if you gave them all the doctors your husband has seen. Your in the same position I was in for the most part, I was looking for the best of the best. My local doctor here in Northern Colorado gave me a list of people to contact and he let them know I would be contacting them. On a positive note, the people I spoke with at USC Norris recommended Dr Wilson and thought highly of her. Either way with MD Anderson or CU/Dr Wilson is a win win with both being state of the art facilities with exceptional doctors.\n\nI think the biggest decision for you will be traveling for treatment. Stay on top of things and take notes while at the doctors. All this is very treatable if caught early so maybe push a little. Go and see Dr Wilson on Monday for sure and see what she would recommend. If you have any questions she is very good about answering them, and she keeps it at a level that you can understand.\n\nBill\t\t\t", "date": "2011-04-26T00:51:14+00:00", "topic": "Husband got not so great biopsy info back today", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tDon\u2019t take any risks with the grade 3 stuff.

I don\u2019t know whose worse, the doctor or your husband. My wife has been my biggest advocate on this journey and all my doctors respected that and made sure she was in the loop. It sounds like your holding back on your feelings for the doctor\u2026 I have talked to a few people in the past that had this cancer who were stubborn and waited to long or were under treated because it was more convenient. It tore their families apart. The end game becomes obvious after a certain point messing around.\n\nIt is hard to be on the caregiver side as you don\u2019t have to \u201cwear\u201d the stress of having the cancer. That\u2019s no excuse though to make you crazy. My wife can be pretty blunt, and when things slowed down, she spoke her mind. Your husband should be happy you want it done with now and not drag out the misery.\n\nTo bad about the cooking. Once I took control of that the world changed. Is there anyone in his family you can talk to that might get through to him and push for another doctor? The VA seems scary with simple things, this cancer and VA hospital shouldn\u2019t be in the same sentence. Also sounds like the doctors got patients mixed up from poor communication?\n\nDon\u2019t give up! Remember slow and steady. Something you might enjoy, my wife can be very blunt, the day before my surgery we went for a walk and got our mail. Two different funeral homes mailed info packets. My wife said she wanted them just in case I changed my mind in the morning and didn\u2019t go through with the surgery. A couple of days later in the hospital I found them in a folder I had taken with us. I asked her why they were in there and she said if I didn\u2019t go through with the surgery, I would have something to read living in a motel\u2026 maybe call and ask for info so when he checks the mail?\n\nKeep checking in and venting.

I craved stuff I never liked. Keep lots of different snacks around and pack some of them for when he\u2019s at chemo.\nThe only time I needed the meds was before going in the car, easy, 20 minutes before leaving. Have him drink plenty of water, helps with the chemo drugs. Also watch for constipation, some of the drugs given with the chemo drugs will cause that. The chemo bag works very well, might throw in some light snacks and a light jacket too. Towards the end he might need/want a ride for treatment because of the fatigue. Also, glasses or contacts, the chemo could cause a shift, so tell him not to panic.

The biggest part of regaining continence is kegel exercises and a schedule to train your new bladder. This is a learned process, not healing. If your cath was pulled in the last few days, you\u2019re just getting started. It really will get better.\n\nBe careful with your liquid intake before bed time and find ways to get rest. With the training schedule it can lead to sleep depravation pretty fast and if you get too run down, you\u2019ll never wake up in time to make it to the bathroom. If the kegels are not working after a while, you might talk to you doctor about biofeedback therapy.\n\nI had my surgery Nov 2 2010, and towards the end of Dec turned 49.
