I am so sorry about your recent diagnosis. I was also diagnosed at age 55.\n\nI am one of the few people here who have had a partial cystectomy. Unfortunately I do not think given your diagnosis you are a candidate for that procedure. In my case, my tumor was a primary adenocarcinoma, a different type than your diagnosis. Although quite rare, it is generally the only tumor type considered for a partial procedure, and then only a subset of people meet the very strict criteria. This is due to it very likely being one single tumor less likely to recur in the bladder if caught early. My procedure was in Feb 2010.\n\nShould you have a partial cystectomy, with the high-grade muscle invasive bc, it could recur in another area of your bladder. It is already invasive.

As Cynthia said, a partial hasn't traditionally been used for transitional cell carcinoma (TCC), but perhaps in your husband's case, the doctor is thinking that if he can remove the area where the T2 invasive tumor was found with clean margins, then with regular monitoring, he can take care of any future recurrences before they progress past the Ta or T1 stage.\n\nIt seems doctors are leaning more toward bladder preservation if possible, so that sounds like the approach Dr. Baracus is taking. The tumor site being in the dome is the area that allows the partial to be done. Just ensure you have a very candid discussion of how he would handle any future tumors because TCC does have a pretty high probability of recurrence.\n\nAs far as my own partial cystectomy, I cannot tell any difference now as far as bladder capacity than before the surgery. My tumor site was fairly small, so the resected wall was probably likewise.\n\nBest of luck as the two of you move forward with his treatment. Please keep us posted as to how he is doing.

To reiterate what Cynthia said, welcome to the forum. I have read your post with interest because as others have thought, this doesn't seem to follow what we are used to as being the more common treatment path. The type of bc will dictate the best way to proceed.\n\nI did have a partial cystectomy in 2010, but only after a 1.6 cm tumor was removed via a TURBT procedure and diagnosed/staged via a path report. There is a big difference in these two processes.\n\n- A TURBT is done, as you stated, via an instrument inserted into the bladder to remove the tumor, and take other areas of tissue if needed for biopsy. It is a short out-patient procedure and you go home in a few hours.\n\n- A partial cystectomy is major surgery where a complete section of the bladder is removed. The bladder is sutured and you will have to wear a catheter during the healing process, which for me was almost a month. Your uro has mentioned robotic surgery which may decrease the healing time for the abdominal incision, but the bladder still has to heal on its own. I opted for open surgery which involved an incision from just below the navel to just above the pubic bone.\n\nPartial cystectomy is most often recommended for a bladder adenocarcinoma, which is one of the rare types of bc. If your path report hasn't come back, I'm not sure why they are making that recommendation so soon. The fact that they mentioned some other small areas needs to be investigated as well.\n\nWhen you talk to them again, ask for a copy of your pathology report so you can fully understand your diagnosis, and the options they are offering. Also, a second opinion is always a good idea.\n\nI had my initial TURBT locally but when the path report came back, my uro referred me to Vanderbilt because of the rarity of my diagnosis in his practice.\n\nI am glad you are here in the forum looking for information.

I'm very sorry to hear about your wife's diagnosis. I know both of you are scared and overwhelmed with information. As Sara Anne said, I was diagnosed with a bladder adenocarcinoma in January 2010. A local uro did the TURBT and as soon as my path report came back, he said right up front that he did not have much experience treating this rare tumor and he referred me immediately to Vanderbilt Medical Center in Nashville. There was no talk of waiting to do a second TURBT. I was at Vanderbilt within 2 weeks.\n\nWhen I went for my first consult with the Vanderbilt surgeon, he said his recommendation was to do a partial cystectomy which would remove the portion of the bladder around the tumor site. He also said we could \"wait and watch\" but made sure I understood that cancer cells are like toothpaste... once they are out of the tube you can't put them back in. I opted for the partial cystectomy.\n\nWhere is she being treated? Ask how many times they have treated this type of tumor. I am not comfortable with the doctor \"thinking\" it is localized to the bladder, or waiting to do a second TURBT in a few weeks. These tumors are always invasive. My doctor treated my case with urgency and after he removed the small portion of my bladder, a tiny area of cancer cells was found in the specimen meaning the TURBT had not gotten everything and it had started to invade the muscle layer.\n\nMy advice is to get a second opinion as soon as you can, preferably at a major bladder cancer hospital, to see if another experienced uro agrees with your doctor's approach. With bladder cancer, you have to be your own best advocate and push for getting the best treatment possible. Also get a copy of the path report so you know exactly what was found and how they staged the tumor.\n\nI don't mean to scare you more than you already are. It sounds like they caught your wife's early which is very good. Mine was caught fairly early as well, and that was almost six years ago. Please let us know how things develop.\n\nGive your wife my best wishes. I know how it feels to be in those shoes...\t\t\t", "date": "2015-06-26T01:25:45+00:00", "topic": "Adenocarinoma in Bladder", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tHello and welcome to our forum. You will be moving to east TN at a very pretty time of year. I'm sorry you're dealing with your recent diagnosis and that you've had this delay in getting your BCG treatment started.\n\nI am in the sister city of Bristol, VA. I wish I could recommend a doctor, but I have not been treated by any uro's in the Tri-Cities since the initial TURBT in 2010. My ob/gyn first found my tumor and sent me to a local uro who removed it. When he got the path report back and saw that it was one of those \"rare\" ones, he referred me to Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. I have gone back there for every one of my follow-up checks.\n\nWhen I go back to Vanderbilt in October, if all is still clear, my uro/surgeon said he thinks it's time to stop the yearly CT scans to reduce my radiation exposure after nearly six years of scans. I'm not sure I want to drive 300 miles just for a cysto so I may look for a uro in Knoxville. It's only a couple of hours from here.\n\nAnother forum member, DougG, is near Knoxville and his doctor (or professional group) would be my first choice for someone more \"local\" than Nashville for my cystos and monitoring. If I ever need surgery again, I will go back to VB. I'm not saying there aren't any good uro's in the Tri-Cities... I just don't have any personal knowledge of their experience level.

When I was in the whirlwind of diagnosis, surgery prep, etc., I didn't even know what to ask because I didn't know who to ask.\n\nAs far as experience with these rare tumors, there isn't a lot out there just because they don't happen very often. I went to Vanderbilt University in Nashville for my surgery. They are a highly rated facility for bladder cancer. I got referred there because my local uro said he didn't know anything about treating me because he might see one case like this in ten years. Even though Vanderbilt was 300 miles away, it was the right decision for me.\n\nAt my first consult with my surgeon, I asked about chemo and he said he wouldn't even know what type to use because there really wasn't a protocol for it. Keep in mind that he already had the path report from my initial TURB when the tumor was removed by my hometown uro. My tumor was in the perfect place to allow the partial cystectomy procedure. Unfortunately, not all adenocarcinomas meet that criteria.\n\nI don't have a guess as to why your doctors are looking so closely elsewhere, but hopefully they are just being thorough and careful. You could just ask them why and what they are looking for. Maybe it's just because it is rare for adenocarcinomas to start in the bladder (aka primary) since it is the same type of tumor that is often found in cases of colon cancer, but they ruled that out already for you.\n\nIf you, and your doctors, are certain that bladder removal is what is needed, then another TURB is most likely not needed. That is generally done to check the results of the first one and to confirm the diagnosis. At this point after all the tests you've had, a diagnosis should have been firmly determined.\n\nI'm so sorry you're facing this challenge. I know you are tough. You've faced 90 miles of bears and whitewater rapids. You know how that fear felt. The fear of bc is paralyzing in the beginning when all these decisions need to be made.

I am very sorry I did not see your post before your appointment. My pathology report came back stating that it was a 'primary adenocarcinoma of the bladder' which means they determined it originated in the bladder and was not mets from another site. I don't know the science behind the pathologists findings.\n\nThere were no other tumors present, the margins were clear of cancer, as well as the three lymph nodes that were excised for pathology. I used the term \"lone wolf\" (not the doctor) since it was a solitary tumor at that time. I can only hope that remains the case in the future, but there is still a chance of mets elsewhere even after 5 years or more. That is the scariest part of bc.\n\nI guess there is really no way to be 100% sure, but based on tissue specimens examined, that was the conclusion. I have been CT scanned every year since my partial cystectomy in Feb 2010 and nothing suspicious has been found. The doctor has suggested that we do one more annual scan, then stop the CT's due to the radiation exposure, and just do cystoscopies.\n\nPlease let me know how your appointment went.

I want to add my welcome to our forum. I am sorry to hear about your husband's diagnosis.

The importance of alternative practices that can help bring emotional healing and inner peace cannot be overstated.  I think that is where the alternative medicine can be invaluable.\n\nOver the past five years since my diagnosis, I have had difficulty coming to terms with it, the fear it induces in my day to day life, emotional state, etc. I will say it has gotten further away from my immediate thoughts as time has passed, but is never completely gone since I tend to be anxiety prone. I have not tried reiki but have done Myofascial Release Therapy which helped tremendously with both anxiety, physical pain unrelated to bc, mental relaxation, as well as helping with chronic insomnia.

A section of intestine is used to fashion a pouch inside your body but instead of being attached to the urethra as in the neobladder, it is attached to a stoma in the abdomen (sometimes naval). You do have use a catheter to empty the pouch every few hours and after some weeks/months of \"training\" it seems to settle in enough to get a good night's sleep with one/two times to get up, depending on how long you stay in bed.

It is a very scary prospect for anyone at any age. A 75-ish year old family friend was recently diagnosed with lung cancer. She is also a very long-time smoker. She took a few radiation/chemo treatments and decided it was just too painful and difficult and has opted for better quality of life without treatment until the cancer runs its course to a final outcome. It is not what her family wanted her to do, but in the end, it was up to her to decide.\n\nI know this is extremely difficult for you and your family.

I know you are scared and confused and we have all been right where you are right now after first getting such devastating news. Waiting to find out the results is a frightening wait that seems to take forever.\n\nI will attempt to answer your questions in a general way. Don't assume the worst until you have your pathology report explained to you and your doctor has determined exactly what you are dealing with. I hope other forum members will add, clarify, or correct my info below if needed.\n\nNot all bladder tumors are cancerous, but unfortunately, it seems most of them are with varying degrees. That being said, most are VERY treatable today with very favorable outcomes. A tumor that is non-invasive generally affects only the superficial layer on the inside of the bladder. A tumor that is diagnosed as invasive has penetrated through the lining (or has the potential) and into the muscle wall of the bladder. Once a cancer has gotten into the muscular wall, it is possible for it spread elsewhere via the bloodstream or lymph system, and the deeper the invasion the higher the probability of that happening over time. (It doesn't happen in every case which is why this is just general info.) This is why early detection is very important.\n\nAfter removal of the tumor, a low-grade non-invasive diagnosis is generally treated with a solution into the bladder for a number of treatments plus periodic followup cystocopies to keep an eye on things to watch for any recurrence. Lots of people here have been through the BCG treatments with very good success.\n\nA diagnosis of high-grade means that an identified cancer is deemed aggressive and will likely become invasive into the bladder even if it hasn't yet. Treatment in these cases has to be decided with the patient and doctor whether surgical removal of the bladder is indicated at that time, or if other treatments seem more appropriate before going that route. Each case of bladder cancer is very individualized to a person's particular diagnosis and history.\n\nRemember, this is just general information you can find on many medical websites and at this point doesn't apply to you specifically. You need to focus on the fact that bladder cancer (IF that is your diagnosis) is highly treatable.\n\nAgain, welcome and I am sorry you have had to seek us out.

Since the ultrasound showed a definite \"mass\" in there, the uro scheduled me for the TURBT the following week without even doing a cystoscopy first. I was sent for a CT scan two days before the surgery which he used as a reference for removal of the tumor.\n\nAll that eventually lead to me being referred to Vanderbilt Medical Center for a partial cystectomy in Feb. 2010. Since then, I have had a pelvic/abdominal CT scan every 11 to 12 months to check for recurrence/mets, along with either 3 or 6 month cystoscopies.  I asked my surgeon about the CT vs. MRI and his preference so far has been the CT scan. Even though I have some concerns about the radiation, I have left it up to his expertise to choose which gives him the clearer picture of what is going on in my body. So far, I have been clear each time!\n\nDuring your appointment, ask about the merits of CT vs MRI, and I'm sure they will tell you their preference as to which might give them a better image for what they need to do at this point. Discuss any concerns you have.\n\nWrite your questions down ahead of time because I know so often I have forgotten something during the stress of just being there discussing my diagnosis or procedure.

I am so sorry you find yourself here looking for information on bladder cancer. I was not familiar with the term \"sessile\" and did a bit of reading on the internet but there isn't a lot of references out there that I found. I know you are scared out of your wits hearing this from your doctor after your ultrasound.  At this point, don't get ahead of yourself because it is human nature to jump to thinking the worst. Points to think about:\n\n1) Your urologist is the first in line for determining what needs to be done. The cystoscopy will allow him/her to look inside your bladder and take tissue samples for biopsy purposes.  That will be a start to know how to proceed from there.\n\n2) Regardless of what the biopsy says, the tumor will have to be removed through a procedure called a TURBT which is a transurethral resection of a bladder tumor (mass).  It's done under anesthesia as an outpatient procedure, and pathology will be done on tissue that is removed for a more complete diagnosis.\n\n3) We strongly encourage a second opinion after your path report comes back, and at a hospital/center that specializes in bladder cancer.  Studies have shown that an experienced facility with a high volume of bladder procedures often leads to better outcomes for patients. A second TURBT is often done to confirm the findings of the first one. Much depends on whether this mass is found to be invasive, aggressive, or possibly even benign. There are many variables at this point.\n\n4) Find out the level of experience of your referred urologist. Ask how many times he has seen your particular type of tumor. Even if he does the cystocopy, you can ask to be referred to someone else to do the TURBT if you are not satisfied with his credentials. I see you are in Maryland, and I'm sure some of our members can recommend some doctors/hospitals who are considered tops in this field.\n\nI know this is not very comforting to you, but knowing what to expect hopefully can help you formulate some questions for your appointment. Please let us know how your cystocopy goes and I send you my most positive thoughts as you go through this.\t\t\t", "date": "2012-09-19T01:39:37+00:00", "topic": "newly diagnosed sessile bladder mass", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tHello...

I can only speak for myself on that, but as part of my followup I have them every six months now, and every three months for the first almost two years after my surgery. My urologist uses numbing gel and mine have never been painful (slightly embarrassing the first time).

I have been where you are, as have most of us here. It is truly a scary and confusing time. My gynecologist discovered a \"mass\" in my bladder during an ultrasound looking for why I might have been experiencing a little blood in my urine. I went to her because a bladder issue never crossed my mind since I'd never even had a UTI in my life. Had never really heard of BC at that point. But she was thorough and voila... there it was on the screen. A walnut looking thing clinging to the lining of my bladder about 1.6 cm.\n\nBefore I left her office, her staff called a local uro and made me an appointment and sent the ultrasound pictures to him. At that point, we knew there was something in there that had to come out so we went straight to scheduling the surgery (TURBT). I was sent for a CT scan a few days before and the urologist used that as a reference for removal. He found only that lone tumor and got it out of there. A TURBT is an outpatient procedure and isn't nearly as scary as it sounds.\n\nAfter my path report came back, the uro sent me to a larger hospital because mine was not the more typical type of BC. If there's something that's not supposed to be in there and a CT scan has verified it, not sure why they would do a cystocopy first since they can take a look inside at the same time as removal.\n\nAs Mike said, finding a a hospital known for expertise in treating BC is very important. A recent study has shown that many urologists are not really experts in BC and do not follow the recommended treatment protocols. I see you are in California. If you let us know where, someone here can give you some recommendations as to where you might go for a second opinion.\n\nAnd adding to Mike's post... although just hearing the word \"cancer\" scares us witless (as someone here aptly put it), it is NOT a death sentence. We are here as a testament to that. First step is to find out if it is cancer, then if so, what type you are dealing with so you and your doctor/surgeon will come up with a plan to attack it and defeat it.\n\nWe understand the newness and shock of your diagnosis.

Welcome to our forum. I certainly understand your worry since your husband has had bladder cancer at such a young age. It's hard not to jump to conclusions waiting to see his urologist but other things can cause microscopic blood in urine. Possible other causes are a UTI or a kidney infection for example. At any rate, it is always imperative to get it checked out thoroughly which you will be doing soon.\n\nTo answer your question about recurrence after five years, unfortunately with bladder cancer that is a possibility at any age. Some members here have had to have subsequent series of BCG treatments after a recurrence. Treatment options just depend on the pathology (stage/grade) at the time it is discovered. But, until you know from your uro, you're not there yet.\n\nI sincerely hope that it is just a minor infection that can be dealt with quickly. Please post any other questions you may have.

Bladder cancer is very treatable, and the earlier treatment gets started, all the better for the patient.\n\nI think most first discussions with a urologist about bladder cancer include the possibility of a cystectomy (bladder removal).

I am so sorry to hear about your diagnosis. I posted a reply to you in the other thread before I read this one. I know how shocked you must be right now because I, and most everyone on this site, knows how hearing those words nearly knocks you to your knees... even more so at only 35 years old.\n\nAs I quickly found out, there isn't much information out there on bladder adenocarcinomas since they are in the \"rare\" category which makes this even scarier to deal with. I see you have already gotten a second opinion which is good. Did both doctors agree on the course of treatment for your surgery?  It helps to have confidence in your doctor as you go through this so I hope you can get your concerns satisfied by discussing them with your surgeon. It's only natural to be scared and concerned, even with the best of doctors because when it's happening to YOU, it's impossible not to have those feelings.\n\nThe partial cystectomy has worked very well for me but I did not have to have any repair done other than just suturing up the tumor site at the dome where the wall was removed. What size is your tumor? Mine was relatively small (1.6 cm) but had invaded into the first half of the wall (T2a), so maybe the size is why some repair work has to be done in your case. Since colon tissue is used for urinary diversions, it must be compatible with the bladder and is why they propose to use it that way.  I haven't heard of that, but in theory it makes sense.\n\nYou've obviously educated yourself on several aspects of bladder cancer and surgeries, and gotten a second opinion which is good. Some of those reports and statistics are pretty daunting, but treatments have improved since most of those were compiled. You are young and strong which will help in your post surgery recovery.

So sorry to hear about your diagnosis. You are the only other person I have heard from that had an adenocarcinoma. I did not have to have any repair done to my bladder. He just removed the portion of the wall around the tumor site and sutured it up. My tumor was also at the dome and relatively small (1.6 cm) and was only inside the bladder.  They did not call mine a \"urachal adenocarcinoma\".  During the surgery, the doctor did remove the urachal remnant but the pathology report showed it clear of any cancer.\n\nHow did they diagnose you? Is the tumor outside the bladder and present in the urachus?  Perhaps that is why he needs to do some repair there. There are many people here who have had a portion of the colon used to create urinary diversions after their bladders have been removed. Using it to repair a portion of bladder, if that is what he is planning to do, is something I am not familiar with either.\n\nDid he give you other options? I was thrilled to be able to have just a partial rather than to have my bladder removed. I do understand a small percentage of patients fit the criteria to only have the partial procedure. It will be a year post-op on Feb. 25th and my bladder looks like it did before I had the surgery when viewed onscreen during my last two cystoscopies.\n\nWrite down your questions or things you are uncomfortable with to discuss with your doctor. Ask him how many times he has performed your suggested procedure. It may not be too many since these tumors are relatively rare.\n\nYou will find a lot of expertise and comfort by sharing your experiences, questions, and concerns here.

About the scope:  The first time I went for a cystoscopy, I was so scared it was going to hurt. My blood pressure was really high when they took me back and I'm usually around 105/65. Afterwards I was so relieved that it was not painful at all, just a bit embarrassing at first. The nurse who prepped me was so warm and comforting that I was able to relax a bit. She inserted some numbing gel first, and after a few minutes when the doctor came in, there was very little discomfort when he inserted the scope. He can put the video on a screen so you can see what he is looking at also.\n\nNow after at least 10 checkup visits, it's old hat.

I have been scanned 5 times now at approximately yearly intervals. The first time was to confirm my diagnosis and clearly showed a tumor that was approx. 2/3 inch.

I am sorry to hear that you have been recently diagnosed with bladder cancer. If one has to have it, about the best case scenario is \"low-grade, non-invasive.\" It is very treatable but will require very close monitoring to catch any recurrences in the future. Until told otherwise, you should expect a normal, otherwise healthy life based on the diagnosis you received.

No doubt this is a very scary time.\n\nAs I'm sure you have read, smoking is listed as the number one risk factor, but many of us here have never smoked, so that may or not have contributed to yours. That being said, if you can quit I would think that is so much the better for a variety of reasons.\n\nIt is generally thought that doing a second TURBT a few weeks after your initial tumor removal is good practice. That will verify that nothing was left behind, or has returned, or that everything still looks good. Speak to your urologist about that. Also, the cited standard is to be rechecked with a cystoscopy every three months for much of the next two years after diagnosis, then moving to six-months, then yearly as appropriate.\n\nAgain, welcome to the forum.

Some were tender and some not, depending on where they were located. Some of the larger ones were on her torso, and there were some in her breasts and upper arms, thighs, and lower legs as well. She lived in fear most of her life that she had cancer, but none of them ever became malignant.\n\nMy mother's condition seems to be inheritable. I have five siblings, and all of us have at least one of these just-under-the skin growths. Also, some of my sisters' children (now all grown) have them as well.\n\nPlease let us know if you get additional results from your cultures.

I can definitely see why you are frustrated with the differing opinions of various doctors. There may be a confusion of terminology between them. Unfortunately, there are too many urologists that aren't experts on bladder cancer.\n\nThe term \"superficial\" tumor is used a lot (they are moving away from that term since it seems to trivialize the seriousness of it). It can still be cancerous. Removing them generally leaves the patient cancer free... until another comes back. The purpose of BCG treatments is to attempt to prevent recurrences.\n\nTo really know what is going on in your situation, you need to ask for copies (if you haven't already done so) of your pathology reports and any other surgery reports that are in your case history. You have a right to them but I've noticed most offices don't offer copies unless the patient asks for it.\n\nPerhaps after looking at those, some of us here can help you better understand what is going on with you. Often you have to know what you want from the doctor as far as treatment and be assertive in getting it. I would inquire again about the BCG when you go back next time. It has helped many of our members here.

Welcome to our forum. I am very sorry that you had to seek us out due to your bc diagnosis. None of us are medical doctors, but we do have a large collective knowledge of bladder cancer because we (or a loved one) have been there.\n\nNo one would opt for an RC if it weren't a potentially life-saving procedure. While it is good news that your tumor has decreased in size, you also need to consider that although it is smaller, it is still there. As long as it is inside your bladder, it has the potential to invade further into the muscle wall, especially a high-grade tumor. From there it can spread to other parts of your body.\n\nI don't intend this as a scare tactic, but only as information to think about. You've probably thought about little else since your diagnosis. It is so very hard to make these life altering decisions. It's not an exact science... we just have to go with what seems best for long term survival.\n\nAlso we encourage everyone who is newly diagnosed to seek a second opinion at a large hospital that treats many cases of bladder cancer each year (if you are not already at such a place). If you give us your location, perhaps someone here can give you a recommendation. Again, welcome.

I do hope you hear something very soon as to getting her scheduled to start treatment.\n\nIt is generally standard protocol to also do the hysterectomy at the same time for women; and for men, they remove the prostate at the same time as well.

That has been shown in some studies to improve the outcome later down the road by potentially stopping further spread.\n\nThere is no doubt that this is a difficult surgery, but her younger age should work in her favor for recovery time if she is in generally good health otherwise. Support from family is powerful medicine as well, and I can tell that you are there for her in spite of being so scared yourself.\n\nI haven't been through a cystectomy, but there are others here who have and are several years down the road from their surgery.

From what I have understood from others here, the surgery will take a few hours and you can probably expect to be in the hospital from 7 to 10 days depending on how quickly things start working again with your bowels, etc. The bag diversion is the least invasive of the diversions, so hopefully that will mean a little shorter stay.\n\nHave you discussed this with your surgeon? Your questions are things every patient facing major surgery would want to know. Is it possible to call the office of your doctor and talk to one of his/her staff? They should be able to give you more information.\n\nAlso, I want to add that we do have members who who have the external bag and they do quite well. I don't know about stoma care, but in the USA, there are nurses who specialize in caring for stoma patients and teaching them what they need to do to keep everything healthy. I'm sure you will be shown how to take care of yourself before you leave the hospital.\n\nI'm sorry I don't know more about your upcoming operation but I hope this helps just a little bit.

Sounds like your surgery went well and you have weathered it remarkably being only ten days out. I'm really sorry about finding cells in the 7 nodes. I haven't had chemo so I can't respond to that part of your question, but I do believe you are in good hands at Vanderbilt. Dr. Cookson is my doctor/surgeon also.\n\nThere are quite a few members here who have had chemo who can share their experiences with you. It's generally pretty quiet on Sunday evenings so don't get dismayed if you don't hear from too many others yet. They will be around soon.\n\nOne thing I can add is to follow their instructions NOT to lift over 5-10 pounds until they tell you different. You will risk developing incisional hernias later (don't ask how I know). I found that when I overextended myself (like vacuuming even) while I had the catheter in the first couple weeks after surgery, I would see blood in the bag. I think I probably also pulled some stitches lifting my dogs too soon. You may never have a better excuse to take it easy, so take advantage of it!\n\nBest wishes for speedy healing from surgery and getting on with whatever you need to do to rid your body of those nasty BC cells.\n\nCatherine\t\t\t", "date": "2012-10-21T17:34:13+00:00", "topic": "Recent radical cystecomy", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tHi Kenny...

It doesn't seem that there is enough data on bladder adenocarcimomas to pinpoint a standard protocol, and it will vary per each patient's case. I am basically trusting my uro surgeon's expertise and comfort level since Vanderbilt is a major center for BC. I had 3 cystos at 3 month intervals and a CT scan at the last one in November, then this one which was at 4.5 months.\n\nEven though my tumor had invaded into the muscle layer, there was no lymph involvement per the path report and no mets detected on my initial CT scan. The bladder wall at the tumor site was resected with two clean margins, and no followup treatment required. Fortunately mine was fairly small and at the bladder dome which made it possible to do a partial cystectomy.  The stats are that less than 2% of all BC's are adenocarcinomas. I read that of those 2% of patients, less than 5% meet the criteria for partial cystectomies, so not a lot of case studies available. I feel extremely fortunate at this point and hope things continue to go well.\n\nHe also said that if the next cysto and CT scan in October were clean, we can relax the monitoring a bit.  That will be at the 20 month mark and I'm not sure what that will look like.

First I just want to say bravo to you for taking charge of your care and going to a hospital where you feel your needs will be better addressed. News like this is a punch in the gut that leaves you barely able to breathe.\n\nThe pain you experienced that took you to the ER may/may not have been related to your bladder, but it might be a blessing in disguise if in the course of looking for its source, a developing bladder tumor was found. At 1.5 cm, that is still fairly small (mine was 1.6 cm which is about 2/3 inch) and with any type of tumor, the earlier found and treated, the better. They don't turn out to be benign very often, but sometimes it does happen. The pathology report after your TURBT will determine whether it is a bladder cancer or not. Also keep in mind, even if it is, these days bladder cancer is very treatable. You will find lots of posts in the forum that attest to that.\n\nAs far as the procedure, it is usually done outpatient unless there are compelling reasons to keep you overnight. Given the distance you will be traveling, it may depend on if/when they want to recheck you. I went back the next morning to my local uro, and I have seen people here say they went back after a \"few\" days. Maybe a call to their office and ask about post-TURBT procedures they have in place would ease your worry just a bit.\n\nDid you see a urologist at any point during this? If your pain continues or increases, try to see a local uro, or your primary care physician in case it is not your bladder causing it. You shouldn't have to be in pain for the next 10 days.\n\nWe are here to help as much as we can, especially when people like yourself are first diagnosed.

There is just no way to absorb a loss like that except over time.\n\nI definitely believe stress, especially the sudden severe emotional distress over your brother, paired with the stress of dealing with a diagnosis of BC, has a potentially devastating effect on overall health.  Just a few days ago some articles were published about things like that making a person sick. Not being able to eat and sleep can compromise the immune system.\n\nI applaud your making an appointment to see someone to help deal with it all.

They can also offer some strategies for coping techniques.\n\nI hope others can chime in with any BCG advice.  I've never had it so am of no help on that front.

So glad to read your good news!\n\nThis is just my two cents worth on the supplement. I had never heard of Bladder 2.2, so I looked it up. Obviously they are reputable. Looking at the ingredient list, I don't see anything that would support the claim \"forumlated to support a healthy bladder lining.\" I also see that it has fillers to bind the tablet together.  This is something that I would not be interested in using, and I am always suspicious when the name of a product targets a particular disease in that they pander to a group of people who may be desperate to find that miracle pill, and at over $100 for 3 months. And, I also suspect that they offer a physician referral discount because the doctor gets a \"referral fee\". But that may just be my conspiracy-theory mind talking. lol\n\nI do take a multivitamin (Essential-1), along with omega-3 and Co-Q10 supplements, but not because I had BC. I use products from Andrew Lessman (ProCaps Laboratories in Nevada) who uses zero fillers in his products and they are a fine powder in a gel capsule so they are immediately available shortly after swallowing, unlike a hard tablet. The products are also available on Home Shopping Network if you want to compare ingredients which look to be similar.\n\nThere are a lot of supplements out there so it is a very personal decision as to which products to use. Researching to find a product you trust is the most important part of that decision.\n\nContinued good health to you!\t\t\t", "date": "2012-01-06T19:05:15+00:00", "topic": "How lucky can a gal with BC be?", "subforum": "10-women-and-bladder-cancer"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tHello Joe...

Sorry you're feeling so tired, but I think that is a normal part of the recovery process from a very serious surgery like you had. Your body has been through a lot and needs some time to bounce back.\n\nI only had a partial cystectomy which was much less invasive than your procedure and my post-op instructions said specifically not to drive for two weeks.

Would not be a good thing, so caution is warranted.\n\nLack of sleep really causes tiredness also. I've had severe insomnia for over 8 years so I'm tired most of the time. That being said, it was even more difficult to sleep when I came home from the hospital due to the catheter and having to sleep on my back for several nights until my incision started to heal, and having to get up to empty my night bag. It felt soooo good the first time I was able to turn over and lay on my side. I didn't walk my dog until around the 4-week mark due to possible tugging by my little 20 pound furball.\n\nI sincerely hope you are feeling more rested soon.

Those regular check ups are so important because bladder cancer has the highest recurrence of any other malignancy.\n\nYour story could be written about my nephew.

He is deeply depressed after his cancer and has refused most attempts to get help even though he is surrounded by supportive family. Unfortunately he is an alcoholic in denial. Everyone is at a loss as to what to do, but he has to make the decision that he would rather live than drink. He's not there yet. Short of having him involuntarily committed for residential lock-up treatment, there are few options others can take until he is willing to get and accept help.\n\nIt is very much the same for your husband.

I frequent a forum for Blackberry phone enthusiasts and they are so snarky and hateful with each other.  A 'my phone can beat up your phone' or 'my Blackberry is better that your iPhone' is the constant theme. They pounce on people who innocently ask a question that may have been asked somewhere else in the forum. I mostly lurk because it does provide lots of good techie info.  It could not be more different than this wonderful site full of people who have faced hardships and are willing to share their experience for the betterment of others.\n\nWhen I was diagnosed in January 2010, I was about 75% through a major home renovation (kitchen, 2 baths, master BR).  I was so determined to pick out just the right items, went to the home improvement stores almost daily, and became obsessively involved with all that stuff.\n\nAfter being diagnosed and surgery, I won't say I lost interest in all that, but it no longer seemed so important that all the light fixtures coordinate, or that the new hardware be the exact shape and color. I still have a few things that have not been finished, but I'll get back to it when I get to it.\n\nThe word \"cancer\" just put everything into proper perspective that health and life trumps all of that.  It reset my \"gratefulness\" meter and now as I sit looking out my window at the spring blooms on the trees and the country landscape coming back to life, I feel more contentment than any home \"upgrade\" could ever deliver.\t\t\t", "date": "2011-04-08T06:30:42+00:00", "topic": "How people think?", "subforum": "17-chit-chat"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tI think privacy is an illusion today.
