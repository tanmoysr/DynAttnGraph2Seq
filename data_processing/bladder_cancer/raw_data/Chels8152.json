I am 29 and was diagnosed with low grade bladder cancer in August. I had my TURBT on 8/9/18. I also had a laparoscopy done 10/4/19 due to lower abdominal pain. The laparoscopy found a large fibroid and that was removed. There were two smaller ones but my doctor left those, thinking they wouldn\u2019t be an issue. I have been having bladder pain since 10/10/18. It\u2019s almost an every day thing. I have had three urine samples since my laparoscopy and all show blood and white blood cells. I am feeling a bit anxious to find out what my first three month cystoscopy shows next week.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I actually had a question with this, it was more venting. Thanks for listening!\t\t\t", "date": "2018-11-07T23:20:55+00:00", "topic": "First three month cystoscopy", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}]}
