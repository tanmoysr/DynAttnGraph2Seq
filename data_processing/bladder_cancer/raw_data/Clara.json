We have enjoyed that room so very much so when we came home from the hospital in Sept. and Hospice came in behind us, we just had the bed set up in there for Bob and I have slept on the sofa ever since.\nBob became completely bedridden about a week after we came home so we did not have a choice of moving him anywhere else.   I have my bed rolled up like a sleeping bag every day and just put it back out at night.   Whenever I need a nap and have a chance for one, I just lay back in one of the recliners and sleep.  Bob is still sleeping all night.\n\nI do have a hard time turning Bob to change him and I have found it is much easier to just use the pads on the bed.  He wears hospital gowns and we do not even tie them, just tuck them up around his neck and under the pillow.\nA friend brought two big slanted pillows that have been a great help in supporting him on his side for me to change him.   At first, I used the pillows to hold him over when I turned him but now he cannot lay on his left side except just long enough for me to change him because it hurts his right arm and shoulder so badly.\n\nHe cannot even turn his head to the left.  His right ear stays sore because he lays on it so much but the Hospice nurse brought me something that acts as a barrier when we rub it on the ear and does help.\n\nI have no idea how much Bob weighs now but he has certainly lost a lot of weight.  Eats very little, never gets hungry.  I am starting to see a little confusion now but mostly it seems as if he has been dreaming but never remembers dreaming.\n\nI too follow the book to try to figure out what is going on.   It should not be much longer and it is so sad to see an active man laying so helpless now.\n\nMy heart goes out to all of you along with love and prayers.\nClara\t\t\t", "date": "2008-12-02T06:05:05+00:00", "topic": "Puzzled", "subforum": "7-metastatic-bladder-cancer"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tSorry that I did not read this message before now but the white blood ocunt was 2.9 and the hemoglobin 8.9.\n\nGood Luck\nClara\t\t\t", "date": "2008-09-29T14:07:07+00:00", "topic": "Update on Bob.....", "subforum": "7-metastatic-bladder-cancer"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tJulie,\n\nI have to monitor everything for Bob now too.

All he did that day was keep referring to the bad progonasis, told us the bladder has no feeling.  I finally caught him out in the hall and asked about the bad prog.--it was news that did not surprise me but not what I wanted to hear.  He said we would talk further at our next appt. which was supposed to have been the next week but during the meantime Bob ended up in the hospital and we just had the cath. changed on the last visit and have not seen this dr. again.  Bob was so depressed after our visit to him and I never told Bob about our discussion in the hall.\nWell tomorrow is the big day but I do not want him to be the bearer of bad news to us.   I know it is coming and our oncologist has all ready mentioned Hospice is in the future but I had rather for it all to come from him since he has a much better manner about him.\nI have thought about writing a note for the nurse to put in the file telling him that we will be seeing the oncologist the next day or that he can talk to me but I do not want him to discuss this bad prog. with Bob.

After the scan in May and then the visit to the urologist for the cath. it really hit home what is going on.  I even have started doing some things to prepare for that dreadful day because I do not think I will be able to handle everything at that time.   My daughters have been helping me with that too.\n\nMy daughters do pop in and help me some and even have offered to get someone to come in every other week to clean.   Last night I told my daughter that lives here to let the cleaner come to her house today that I might need her later.  Just felt that with my daughter's job and they moved into a house that they are remodeling, she needs it worse than me.   I can at least keep the areas we use decent.  I am sure it is even harder for you with those beautiful little ones but just enjoy them.   They grow up way too fast.\n\nSince we are having a \"bitchy\" time, maybe today will become a day of laughter.  I try to make sure I laugh at something every day and also share it with Bob.\n\nTake care of yourself.\n\nLove and prayers,\nClara\t\t\t", "date": "2008-07-21T07:24:06+00:00", "topic": "Caregivers,,,,where are you???", "subforum": "20-caregivers-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tGinger,\n\nI love your story...so glad you could give support and have some laughs about the sex too.\n\nClara\t\t\t", "date": "2008-05-14T20:06:53+00:00", "topic": "&amp;amp;quot; PAY IT FORWARD&amp;amp;quot;", "subforum": "20-caregivers-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tWhat great pictures...thanks for sharing.\nClara\t\t\t", "date": "2009-04-02T14:36:15+00:00", "topic": "Competition results", "subforum": "17-chit-chat"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tKaren\n\nI do not know where you found that but there is so much truth in it!\n\nClara\t\t\t", "date": "2009-01-17T14:49:07+00:00", "topic": "The LAWS OF ULTIMATE REALITY", "subforum": "17-chit-chat"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tWe all need a laugh and that is a good one.\n\nClara\t\t\t", "date": "2009-01-07T19:37:52+00:00", "topic": "another slightly-off laugh from Iowa", "subforum": "17-chit-chat"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tWe all need a laugh and that is a good one.\n\nClara\t\t\t", "date": "2009-01-07T19:37:52+00:00", "topic": "another slightly-off laugh from Iowa", "subforum": "17-chit-chat"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tJulie,\n\nThat is precious...a good looking family too.\n\nThanks for sharing....what is going on at your house now?
