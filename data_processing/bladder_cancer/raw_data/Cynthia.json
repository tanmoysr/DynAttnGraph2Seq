When I had my Radical Cystectomy I might have used it for pain control as pain meds make me nauseous but I was in a non legal state at the time. I presently use it as a had a stroke that effected the nerves in my leg and I use it in order to sleep as it controls the pain well. If you look at my signature below you will see my full diagnosis is.\n\nThe first thing you will wish to do is get him certified. Just type into the browser a search for certification in your state. You maybe able to also register as a caregiver and be able to purchase for his use. The reason certification is a good idea even if it is fully legal in your state is there is the tax saving 25% here and the availability of some products that are not available for recreational. Depending on your state you may have to get a referral from one of his doctors or just be assessed at a certification clinic. Here you register online once you have certification pay a $50 fee and they send you a card and you are all set.\n\nI use the edibles and tinctures as I find smoking or vaporizing it to be to harsh and why if there is a way that works well. There are differing types of edibles and tinctures but look for one that has the thc in it. There are types for daytime use night time use and some in the middle. All dispensaries have a menu usually online of the what they have in stock and it can change from day to day. The person who works at the dispensary is called a bud tender and they should be able to help you with most of your questions. If they don\u2019t have the information on strains again type into your search bar the name of the strain and there are several different online \u201cdictionaries\u201d.  Also note that smoking or vaping takes effect within minutes and the effects last about 4 hours with the oral applications taking longer to take effects up to two hours but the effects last 8 to 12 hours depending on the product.\n\nAs for side effects it can give you the munchies and as most of us lose weight following surgery that isn\u2019t a bad thing in most cases. And of course you can not drive another thing I would worry about is it making is if he is elderly and unstable it might intensify the unsteadiness of course depending on the dosage. It also can cause anxiety or paranoia in some if that happens talk to your dispensary and make sure you are not using a Saliva as it is a more stimulating strain. Also it will make you sleepy at some point.\n\nAs for dosage it is different for everyone and may increase with continued usage. But if using edibles or tinctures start with the lowest does and up it slowly until you find the right dosage for him. I personally started with 10mg of tincture now I use about 25mg.\n\nBe aware that not everyone like the way it makes them feel. Also if it is not legal in your state please stay away from it you have enough problems dealing with cancer you don\u2019t need more, there are products the Oncologist can prescribe that can offer comfort that works well. And please talk to his doctors and get their take on this before you go forward. Any alternative treatment used during treatment should be cleared with his medical team as he goes through treatment.\n\nIf you have further questions just yell we are here.\t\t\t", "date": "2019-08-16T23:09:40+00:00", "topic": "Cannabis for coping with side effects of treatment?", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tLee lee and AMG,\n\nFirst AMG I know some Uro\u2019s use a training protocol following RC with both the Indiana and the Neo.

First off let me say this. What treatment one choses is a personal choice. What might seem reasonalbe to one might be unthinkable to another. Having siad that make sure you do your home work. The only real control we have over our disease is the choices we make as medical consumors. The following is something that I posted on the Web cafe list server resently. I feel it might be relivant to the discussion here.\n\nI am the person Linda referred to that failed\nwith the bladder sparing protocol. I had my\ntreatment at the mother source from the dream\nteam that developed the protocol. Now let me say\nthis up front I believe there is a place for the\nbladder sparing protocol for some. But do not\nthink that bladder sparing is a free ride there\nis no such thing in this world. All I ask is that\nyou do your home work and know what it is you are\ngetting into and what happens if it fails.\n\nWhen I was diagnosed I did not even know the\nsymptoms of blc I had to look them up. And as I\nwas searching the reality of the situation set\nin. I was devastated by the thought of having a\nRadical Cystectomy terrified if the truth be\ntold. Terrified of what life would be like after.\nWould I be the same person, sexually, physically\nand mentally? I knew there had to be a better\nway. I hit the internet and when I found the\nclinical trial I would enter within hours of my\nhome I felt I had been delivered.\n\nNow first off Bob be aware not everyone is\nallowed into the protocol, nor should they be.\nThey do stage 2 selectively and stage 3 is very\niffy. It depends on many factors the first being\nthe location of the original tumor. Then you have\nto go through a large battery of tests. So it is\nnot as easy as just saying I want to do this.\nOnce I was accepted this is what my nine month\ntreatment protocol consisted of.\n\n40 sessions of radiation\n\n20 sessions of chemotherapy\n\n5 trips to the OR for biopsies\n\nNumorous CT, bone scans, x-rays, blood work and\nother tests\n\nThis treatment protocol can only be done in a\nlarge center and I would not think of trying it\nwith a medical team that did not do it all the\ntime. The numbers for success are for how many\nmake it though the protocol with their bladders\nintact not how many keep them indefinably. I have\nnever been able to find the numbers on long term\nsuccess with bladder saving. The up side is that\nyou may keep your bladder now lets look at the\npossible down side.\n\nPossible inconstancy or intestinal problems as\nwell as a higher risk of some cancers in the\nfuture due to radiation. If you ever need pelvic\nradiation in the future due to a new cancer you\nhave had the limit and it probably would not be\npossible.\nAs far as the chemotherapy, long term affects are\nnot limited to but may include neuropathy. Due to\nthe fact that they use the big guns as far as\nchemotherapy if you have spread later you may\nhave built up a resistance to some of the best\nfront line chemotherapy drugs now available.\n\nIf it fails and you have to have a Radical\nCystectomy you will find that most surgeons will\nonly offer you an external bag due to the\nradiation. I have found research that concludes\nthat complications are as much as 50% higher in\nRC patients with prior pelvic radiation. It also can\nexclude nerve sparring techniques due to the\nradiation damage.\n\nIn the end my story so far is a happy one I was\nable to find a surgeon that would try to give me\na continent diversion. We could not try for a neo\nbladder because by that time the cancer had\nspread to my urethra. Even though my recovery\ntime was more extensive due to intestinal\ncomplications, I am now up and running again. I am\nactive and do all the things I used to. Like many\nblc survivors I now know that life can be very\ngood following RC.\n\nWhile you are making your decisions on your\ntreatment path don\u2019t lose track of what the\ntrue\nenemy is here and what is the goal. The goal is\nliving and the enemy is the cancer, not losing\nyour bladder.\n\nChin up and straight forward\n\n", "date": "2007-03-27T16:50:15+00:00", "topic": "grade 3, t2n0m0", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tSince I am the one who set up the forum years ago I guess I am the one to answer that.

The day of surgery I was oddly calm and then I was in recovery. I remember being told that the more I walked the sooner I would get well and I walked because getting well was the reason for doing all of this. I remember finally getting the last tube out as I had had an Indiana pouch and how relieved I was. I remember the first time I had the catheter in my hand and I looked up into the mirror seeing the incision the stoma and I cried.

Ten years out I would do all of it over again if I had to. For you see I kept walking and I did get better and that was the reason for the diversion. The cancer behind me I have seen children marry, held my first grand child (#2 is on the way), we renewed our vows and so much more.

One told me he preferred the conduit due to the fact that the surgery does not take as long as other diversions. One liked it because he felt they had fewer post op complications and fewer UTI\u2019\u2018s. One told me he did not do The Indiana Pouch because he worried how someone would deal with it as one aged. Stroke, arthritis or anything that effected dexterity could be complicated and a long term indwelling catheter is an infection incubator.\n\nYour post brought up these questions for me.\n\nWill one diversion or the other lengthen time in surgery?And if so since they are also removing an abdominal mass is the time difference significant? (My RC took 8 hrs.).\n\nDo one or the other diversions have a higher rate of complication post surgery?\n\nYou mentioned your mothers kidney panel wasn\u2019t the best. So I wonder if he feels one or the other diversions is easier on the kidneys?\n\n\nI have a navel stoma with an Indiana Pouch and it works well for me. For four or five weeks after surgery I had a tube and catheter bag set up.  Once you heal enough they remove the indwelling catheter and I started \u201ctraining\u201d my pouch. I set an alarm for every two hours for the first week and added a half hour a week and as time went by my pouch now will go from three to five hours between caths depending on how much I drink. When I first started I was given red rubber catheters and I had to clean and dry them after use, I had several UTI\u2019s and was given a prescription for disposable catheter my insurance pays for a portion of the cost. I some times get what is called pouchitis that is the term for when my pouch is not feeling well. At those times it might leak and I will have excessive mucus in my urine. But I have learned to deal with its picadillos and we get along fine. This was my experience but again ask your medical team what to expect.\n\nI do not have a conduit but doing what I do I know a lot of people with them. The biggest issue\u2019s seem to be stoma placement and finding the right appliance.

The good news is that people adapt and do well with all the diversions.\n\nGood luck.\t\t\t", "date": "2018-10-16T14:51:30+00:00", "topic": "Indiana or ideal conduit?Need fast feedback!", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tI knew I was going to have my treatment with MGH and not my local Urologist after dealing with him though the first TURB.

As for the Bladder Sparing Protocal, I was part of a clinical trial refining it at Massachusetts General Hospital where it was developed. I went through twenty trips to infusion and forty to radiation. I had a reacurrance with in months of finishing tried BCG again reacurrance and went to Radical Cystectomy. I flew to Chicago and Dr. Gary Steinberg who specializes in urinary reconstruction following radiation could do the surgery, I have a umbilical Indiana Pouch. Of course surgery as you know can be more complicated following radiation. Almost all of the residual after effects I have are related to the radiation and not the Cystectomy. The interesting thing about bladder sparing is that the success statistics are done showing those who are successful by the end of the protocal. By that standard I was counted as a success, I would love to see what it was at a year, five and so on.  I would never try to dissuade anyone from from doing bladder sparing but I would suggest if that was your choice to find a bladder cancer center of excellence if that is your choice to maximize your chances of success.

It takes walking as much as you can once they tell you can. It takes getting to the gym and working hard as soon as they tell you you can.

Trust worthy information is vital in order to make informed decisions right for you situations. In a perfect world it would be straightforward, a list handed to each cancer patient simply outlining the best ten choices, and of course they would be numbered in order of effectiveness. Unfortunately there are no simplistic answers. If as most of us you do not come from a scientific background doing an internet search can give more stress than answers. Just trying to get up to speed on terminology while trying to sort out the sites that offer trusted information is a lifetime study rather than a few days or a few weeks of research for the common person. Let alone trying to understand if it applies to your particular diagnosis. The best advise anyone can give to someone newly diagnosed is this, use what you learn in order to form questions for your medical team.\n\nAfter a cancer diagnosis we all feel as if something has happened that is very out of our control. Because of that most of us myself included need to find ways that make us feel in control of the situation. In many ways that is a good thing it helps us find the right doctors, change our lifestyles to a healthier one perhaps, or quit smoking. Through diet we can strengthen our immune systems and help rebuild ourself following treatment, as an example protein plays a big part in our treatment during chemotherapy. We can perhaps reduce our risk of other cancers or future recurrences through positive changes. Any doctor will tell you that in order to possibly reduce your cancer risk that a primary plant based diet, exercise, weight control and stress reduction is the place to start. But once cancer has occurred no one of these things have scientific data backing them as alternative therapies, however they all can be with your medical teams input be complimentary therapies.\n\nAsking your doctor for a referral to a nutritionist is an important first step. Nutritionalists seem to feel that juicing is fine only after you meet your daily intake of fresh fruit and vegetables. Depending on how much fruit you used people can gain weight and have adverse impact on blood sugar. As it is filling you may not be consuming the nutrients and fiber that you need holistically. They also feel that smoothies using whole fruit may a option as many of the nutrients and fiber is found in the skin that is left behind in juicing. Also some nutrients in large quantities can have adverse effects on the kidneys or interfere with the effectiveness of some medications. Gastrointestinal problems from a large amount of juice can in some instances result in people losing nutrients. Non pasteurized juice if not properly handles can cause health problems also. So juicing is not a bad thing but can be if you are not someone fully conversant on these issues and how to avoid them.\n\nI read a lot of research on cancer but after your posts on juicing I spent a few hours today researching it in particular. I found sites making clams of complete cures with no scientific citations, but selling various things. I found sites with personal opinion and stories but again no scientific citations. I found testimonials but no stories of people it had failed. I could find no studies from trusted sources or even untrustworthy ones showing that juicing could cure, slow or prohibit cancer growth. If you have any citations from noncommercial sites showing research on juicing would you please post the links to the information here please?\n\nBelow are some links to information about nutrition and cancer I thought might be of interest.\n\nArticle on bladder cancer and nutrition studies from nih.gov\n\nwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4910759/\n\n\nFrom the American Cancer Society acs guidelines activity and nutrition\n\nwww.cancer.org/healthy/eat-healthy-get-active/acs-guidelines-nutrition-physical-activity-cancer-prevention.html\n\nFrom MD Anderson on juicing\n\nwww.mdanderson.org/publications/focused-on-health/april-2014/juicing-cancer.html\n\nFrom NCI about alternative cancer treatment\n\nnccih.nih.gov/health/cancer/complementary-integrative-research\n\nFrom The American Cancer Society on Alternative and Complimentary treatments\n\nwww.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/complementary-and-alternative-medicine/complementary-and-alternative-methods-and-cancer.html\n\n\nHarvard on Juicing pros and cons\n\nwww.health.harvard.edu/healthy-eating/juicing-fad-or-fab\n\nOncology Nutrition on juicing and cancer\n\nwww.oncologynutrition.org/erfc/hot-topics/should-i-be-juicing/ ", "date": "2018-04-26T03:34:30+00:00", "topic": "Is there any truth to intense cranberry therapy to inhibiting bladder tumor grow", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tI headed to chemo 12 times myself over ten years ago now.

If anyone can understand where you two are coming from it is me. I really really did not want an RC I just knew there had to be another way. Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston is the Mecca of the bladder preservation protocol where a great deal of the research on the topic was done. That is where I went through my treatment under thier protocol. It started in October and ended in May with 40 trips to radiation and 20 to infusion.  My bladder cancer returned by October of that year and after BCG that failed I had a salvage RC at University Of Chicago in May as I was able to find a surgeon who specializes in urinary reconstruction following radiation. I lost my ureathia as the cancer had spreadI but I can honestly say the RC was easier in a way than the protocol. Since then I have had two more surgeries associated with scar tissue and years of physical therapy due to a stroke like event that affected my right leg all they feel were post radiation related. I am not saying that bladder preservation is a bad thing if it works but it does leave you with less options if it doesn't.\nThe reason they do not wait to do an RC following an invasive diognosis is that once it has shown itself to be aggressive is because it has shown itself to be aggressive. Also as good as modern pathology is they can not do a bottom line this is it pathology until they have the entire bladder and close lympnodes to do so. What they need to see is microscopic and can not be seen on a Pet or CT scan.\nAs for not knowing what type of diversion you will have until surgery that is normal. Until they get in there they will not know what they are dealing with. The vast majority get their diversion of choice is the good news but they wouldn't be doing thier jobs if they didn't prepare you just in case.\nLooking back I now realize I was more focused on saving my bladder than surviving the cancer the real enemy. I have a full normal life since my RC and I can honestly say it does not keep me from doing\nanything I want to do. I am not trying to discourage you pursuing bladder sparing but understand it is not a free ride and needs to be done under experienced hands.\nI hope this has helped a little. Have you talked to his surgeon about nerve sparing surgery to preserve sexual function? And make sure they do a high volume of RC's for example my local guy did three or four a year the one that did mine did three to five a week.\nDon't forget we are here if you need us\t\t\t", "date": "2016-11-05T13:59:20+00:00", "topic": "Bladder Preservation", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tSorry you and your family are going through hard times.

The key is getting your appetite back after not eating for a while. Start slow with things that sound good to him. For me it was mac and cheese for him it maybe PBJ. Talk to a nutritionist if you can. Your Dads immune system has taken a big hit and needs to be built back up.

Remember depression can affect appetite also.\n\nThe infections I had one after another it took time. Not only did I up my fluids I tried to infuse my diet in foods high in liquid, water melon and soup as an example. Juicing can be a big help as it give you lots of nutrients and liquid to boot.

I would get a second opinion if you are confused.

The probability of it coming back the same is 60-40 depending on the study but enough to want a review with a center that sees a lot of blc. T1 is noninvasive but it is the one right before T2 so you want to make sure that you are very sure of your treatment and pathology.

We have had people here over the years that would tell you that the type of diversion they have is the best. And the truth of the matter is that surveys find that most people feel that they type they have is the best choice. Having said that there are some differences in the diversions and lifestyle is an important factor. So let's suppose that a person was a good candidate for all the different diversions and that they had a surgeon that did a high number of the diversion chosen.\n\nThe ileal conduit is the diversion most done and that is for a few reasons. It is the one taught to all Urologists while in training. It requires normally the shortest time in surgery and some feel it has the least chance of having post operative complications. There are people who have an ileal and live full lives and adapt to it well. The main issue often times is finding the right appliance that fits their body type and activity level.\n\nThe Neo Bladder is of course one of the continent diversions. It seems to have a better outcome in males where as men can have problems with both hypercontinence and incontinence in woman the rates of these types of problems tend to be higher. But even if the statistics of 1/3 of woman having issues is correct it means that 2/3 have pretty good outcomes. Again a highly experienced surgeon is very important. It could well reduce complication rates but there are no large studies to proves my hypothesis.\n\nThe Indiana Pouch is another continent diversion. It is the one I have. As I was not a good candidate for a Neo Bladder it was my choice. I have had it for about eight years and have adjusted well. It is just a matter of making sure you have supplies when you travel and to keep track of time and fluid input to not have any surprises.\n\nFor people with body image concerns the Neo Bladder and the Indiana Pouch are both popular choices. My stoma is in my naval and does not show; if I had a bikini body to begin with I still would. By the way I didn't and I don't. Also both the continent diversions will have to be trained following surgery once they have healed enough. For a while it is like having a new baby but that is just for a short while. All the diversions have pros and cons but for most of us we learn how to deal well enough after surgery.\n\nI hope that helps if you have specific questions please post them and either myself of someone else will chime in.\n\nGood luck\t\t\t", "date": "2016-03-30T18:00:14+00:00", "topic": "ileal conduit vs. continent diversion", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tDakota, I am sorry you are here but welcome to our community.

The worst thing you can do now is do a lot of reading about things that may have nothing to do with your diognosis and scaring yourself. If you do have bladder cancer 3/4 are none invasive and the largest majority of them are low grade. So right now hold onto the fact that statistics are in your favor here.\nI always had a plan as in I knew what my next step was if I needed to take it. Depending on where you live if you are not going somewhere that deals in a high volume of bladder cancer you need to know where to go for a second opinion if you need it.

Dr. Gary Steinberg of the University of Chicago who specializes in urinary reconstruction following pelvic radiation did the surgery. So it can be done, now the question should it be done? The answer to that would be not ideally. The radiation has a negative effect on the tissue and healing from surgery can be more complicated. And because of the radiation I have had other long term complications. The chemo radiation regime is not an easy one on the body and to go through it and have it fail is devastating  the chemo radiation resume consisted of 40 trips to radiation and 20 to infusion. So make sure you ask questions about what they are proposing. The radiation itself did such damage to my bladder that I was incontinant at the time of my RC .  I chose to try to save my bladder but in hind sight I should have just started where I ended up. The Radical Cystectomy is of course not easy and the adjustment after takes time, but if your father is able to have the surgery it might provide him with the best chance at progression free survival.

I can tell you that they do come out easier than they go in. I would not hesitate removing it yourself if you are at ease with the instructions. If not had you thought of getting a visiting nurse in to do it? Visiting nurses can be found in most phone books. Also your family practitioner might also do it if you give them a call and tell them the situation.\n\nThe amount of urine you will see in the tube naturally varies as the urine is excreted by the kidneys. If you think there is not enough urine coming out you might want to up liquids. If urine stops coming out at all you need to call your Urologist and let them know as the catheter can become clogged after a TURB and the solution can be as simple as it needs to be irrigated.\n\nJust make sure you keep the bag lower than where the tube exits the body. Looping the tube is fine many bags actually come with a little clip that makes it easier to do. Just make sure that the tube does not get a kink in it if you do so.\n\nAlways check with your doctor if you have questions or worries that is what they are there for.

Non invasive means that the cancer is confined to the bladder lining but it has not gone into the muscle, metatasric means it has escaped the bladder. Invasive \"what I would assume your wife is dealing with\" means it has gone through the lining into the muscle of the bladder but has not gone through the bladder wall.\n\nFor invasive bladder cancer the best odds of a cure is a Radical Cyatectomy with a urinary diversion. When I was diognosed ten years ago It was at the invasive stage while and what followed was chemotherapy and bladder removable. There are different types of bladder cancer diversions. I have what is called an Indiana Pouch there is a stoma in my naval and I use a catheter five or six times a day to drain my pouch. Except for having to plan to have catheters my life is as normal as it ever was.

There are very few subjects that when dealing with bladder cancer where more lives could be saved. Many people face delayed diagnosis due to primary care professionals missing the signs and symptoms and putting the pieces together in a timely manner and then many face improper treatment.\n\nIf you ask most medical professionals about bladder cancer and they will tell you that it is a disease of older men and if you have to get a cancer it is a good one to get. Because they are taught half truths they do not look for bladder cancer in a 45 year old woman or a man in his thirties. Because it is not a top of mind cancer they just do not seem to go the extra mile bladder cancer sometimes takes to diagnosis. Because they think it is a good cancer they do not always take it as serious as they would if they knew the whole story.\n\nI believe that I read once there are over 600 types of cancer so it is not to be expected that every doctor know a lot about each one. But one would think that the top ten would at least be part of what was drummed into them. Urologists that do not follow the AUA Clinical Guidelines without clinical reasons should be worried about being accused of not doing due diligence.\n\n(www.auanet.org/content/guidelines-and-quality-care/clinical-guidelines.cfm?sub=bc 2007 reviewed 2010)\n\nOne of the reasons this website was deemed so important was that lives can saved by information.

But if it helps there was an informal survey done of people with urinary diversions and when asked what type they would recommend to someone almost all said the type they had.

You are doing the right you are taking ownership of your health care. Being here and seeking support and knowledge are the wise thing to do.\n\nAs Ann says some of people that are low grade non invasive come when first diagnosed and then move on with life when they find it is just a surveillance thing for them. And only come back if they have a reassurance. I wish they would hang around so that they can help those that come after them. But that is human nature many don't want to hang around things that alarm them so they go on.\n\nWhat you have to learn when dealing with a site such as this is that bladder cancer is many conditions under one name. Non invasive low grade has a survival rate of around 98%, being caught early, accurate staging, proper surveillance and treatment are key. It can be very hard to keep perspective of that when you are reading of people that are dealing with invasive or even metastatic bladder cancer.\n\nWhen I was new to this and was gaining understanding every story and every statistic scared me to death.

I personally have never waited on pathology longer than it took for it to come back usually five working days as I request that they call me wist results. The first one was going to take longer due to the Urologist being out of town and I asked them to fax it to my family care physician and she called me and gave me the results over the phone.\n\nYou need to take a big breath as most of us have waits between diagnosis and treatment beginning. I know that like all of us all you want is this thing treated and gone. Take this time to find the right place to get the best treatment you can find.\n\nEveryone is well advised to get a second opinion from a center of excellence in bladder cancer. You may hear the same thing from both doctors but it is a sanity check and you want to know you are making the right decisions. Now is the time you need to be making that appointment so that you can get in as soon as possible. Call your insurance company and ask what their policy is on second opinions. Mine had what turned out to be a very accurate list of where I might wish to go. Some not only pay for them but insist on them with a major diagnosis.\n\nWhen you get your second opinion you will also have your pathology slides reviewed and again they may well find the same thing.

Asking a loved one to be your partner in your medical care is a great idea it is another set of eyes and ears.

Make sure your pathology report is reviewed by a major center that deals in a high volume of bladder cancer. This does not mean you cannot use your local Urologist. It just means that there is a treatment plan formulated working with someone who specializes in bladder cancer not general urology. For the majority bladder cancer is survivable if they have their regular checkups and get treatment if needed.  But proper diagnosis and treatment from the beginning are vital to a good outcome.\n\nVi you are probably right and it is low grade as your Urologist says. And in that case bladder cancer for you may be as easy as regular checks.

I know the VA has its own way of working but is there any way you could have a doctor call you or that you could ask for a copy of his pathology reports? If not that is the first thing you need to know. The second is if there is spread where it is? I would ask what the goal of the chemotherapy was in real terms of survival and quality of life. There are times when chemotherapy is used to stabilize if not to cure, some times is is done to try and cure, at others it can only add maybe weeks of life with a high impact on quality of life.  I would ask how they handle pain management and if you need a referral to their pain clinic if needed. If you husband is going to take a lot of physical care during treatment you might ask about home health care and how that is handled, or if they have a department such as a special social worker who helps with that sort of thing.\n\nThere will be more questions once you know what you are dealing with.\n\nHope this helps\t\t\t", "date": "2009-08-25T16:05:18+00:00", "topic": "Newbie caregiver with questions", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tThis has became a very long post so I am going to lock it here as you have turned a corner.

Or, cancer cells are growing on the surface of the bladder lining without making a bump (carcinoma in situ), and without growing any deeper.\n\nwww.bladdercancersupport.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=45&Itemid=102\n\n\nExcerpt from the Cleveland Clinic Bladder Cancer Page\nIntravesical therapy - Cancer treatment that is placed directly into the bladder through a catheter rather than being given by mouth or injected into a vein. The most common form of intravesical therapy used in bladder cancer is immunotherapy. This treatment causes the body's own immune system to attack the cancer. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is considered to be quite effective for treating low-stage bladder cancer. BCG, a vaccine derived from the bacteria that causes tuberculosis, is placed into the bladder.  The body's immune systems will then respond to the cancer treatment and destroy bladder cancer cells.  BCG is usually given once a week for six weeks.  Sometimes long-term \"maintenance\" BCG therapy is given. BCG therapy may be combined with a transurethral resection of the tumor. Other intravesical therapies include interferon (immunotherapy) and mitomycin C (chemotherapy). Interferons are naturally occurring compounds that can help slow the growth of tumors. They are administered directly into the bladder through a catheter, just as BCG.  Chemotherapy with mitomycin C can also be administered directly into the bladder. The way chemotherapy works as a cancer treatment is by affecting the DNA of any growing cancer cell. When given directly into the bladder, chemotherapy won\u2019t reach other parts of the body, thus limiting unwanted side effects that can occur with systemic chemotherapy, which affects other organs.\n\nwww.bladdercancersupport.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=15&Itemid=63\n", "date": "2009-04-20T15:24:13+00:00", "topic": "Son newly Dxed BCG questions-bcn33", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tHaving trouble moving this so had to do it manually posted for bcn33\n\nSon recently diagnosed with bladder cancer..\"in situ\" Wondered about the treatments, they are using tuberculin, I understand.

I have told him that getting a second opinion is important to easing his mind on this and helping him make an infomed decition.\nNo..it was a T1 superficial tumor, but high grade 3-4/4, acording to the biopsy..It said 'there was no muscle tissue identified in the sample to be evaluated.\" So, it seems to be superficial..even the URO said that.\nWe started BCG, but the bleeding came back..they did another cytoscope exam,\nand he saw a tumor.. I am guessing it came back..so we have to do another\nTURB.\nOn the yahoo cancer cured group, there are people who say theirs came back\ntwice, and the UROs continued to remove them (TURB)< and continued the BCG,\nuntil the tumor did not come back..One person has has been tumor free or 2\nyears.

In order to enter into the trial you had to undergo a stringent battery of tests and the tumor had to be well placed, also they did very few T3s at all. Some enter into the protocol because they feel it is the easier path than RC. The protocol I went through took me into radiation forty times and chemotherapy 12.  Having done both I can tell you that there are no free passes in the blc game.\nYour question about damage from radiation affecting your choice of diversion in case of failure is an astute one. When I failed the clinical trial and had to go to RC I found that all I was offered due to prior pelvic radiation was an Illiot conduit. Most Urological\nSurgeons will tell you that the radiation changes the tissue so much that the least done the better and the Illiot is the least complicated. While being in my late forties at the time I am very athletic and did not wish to have to deal with an external appliance.   My husband and I traveled to John Hopkins and then to the University of Chicago. Dr. Gary Steinberg of the UCM was willing to try an Indiana pouch. The happy end to the story is that he was able to and I am a year out cancer free and doing very well. But it was a hard recover do to the damage I believe that the radiation had done to my intestines. So to answer your question can radiation affect your diversion choices down the road\u2026.yes and no. If you want anything besides an external appliance you will have to find a surgeon willing to try and even then you will not know for sure until you wake up.\nDuring my research once I knew that I had to have my bladder out I found a research study that found that RCs on patients\u2019 with prior pelvic radiation had fifty percent more complications that those that did not. I once had a resident tell me they call bladders that have been through radiation crispy critters. By the time I went to RC I had little continence left and to this day suffer from what they call anal urgency.  The incidence of secondary cancers is higher do to radiation as time goes on.\nDo I know people that had pelvic radiation and have few side affects\u2026..yes. Do I know people that have had a lot following pelvic radiation\u2026..yes.\nNow having said all of this would I have radiation if I needed it to stay alive? You bet I would. Would I go through chemo again if need be? You bet I would. Would I have skipped the radiation knowing what I do now? Yes because I have came to understand that losing your bladder is not the enemy the cancer is.\nI hope what ever choices you make that you come out the other side as well and happy as I have. And if you need anything do not hesitate emailing me.\n\nCynthia\n", "date": "2007-05-16T23:04:13+00:00", "topic": "Effects of Radiation", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tRee,\n\nFirst let me introduce myself, I am Cynthia Kinsella and I do a moderated chat for the Bladder Cancer Advocacy Network. It is available on our site at www.bcan.org we have a scheduled chat every Sunday evening at 8pm till 9pm eastern time. This chat is open to everyone who has been in anyway affected by bladder cancer and seeks support. We started the chat a little over a year ago and we have an active group. In the next months I am working on expanding the chat I hope to add a once monthly chat for different sectors of our blc family. Non invasive, invasive, care givers, upper track or advanced will be some of the monthly chats options we look at. We have people that chat with us from different countries I have one gentleman for Norway who is with us almost every week. Please join us if you can.\nAnother option is that when you filled out your profile for this forum that there is an option for adding your instant messengers nick names so others can find you that have bladder cancer. It gives you the option of adding your MSN, Goggle Talk, ICQ, AIM or Yahoo messenger ID; this can be a great way to network with others. You can do a private email to anyone on this forum and let them know that if they would like to chat that you are available at your favorite instant messenger. \u00a0\nI wish you all the luck in the world on your bladder cancer journey. You are right one of the best things you can do is talk to and be with others that share that journey.

I have a high tolerance for pain so I felt that something wasn\u2019t typical.

There is nothing wrong with calling your surgeons office and leaving a message with his nurse asking if this is normal is there?

There are multiple types stages and grades of bladder cancer and even if all is equal no two cases will ever progress in the same way. I know as humans we want A to equal A but everyone is different and thier paths will differ because of these differences. Another problem is that if you do a search on cancer you will get over a million matches. Now they tell us that 10% of all internet sites are a scam so that gives you a 100,000 off the top to watch out for. Then there is the whole subset of people that will tell you they cured thier cancer using this or that. They have no studies to show that thier cures work other than antidotal reports. They say things with such authority using great key words that one can walk away feeling they maybe onto something. We have to be very careful because opinion without proof in this case can be deadly.\n\nYour list for juicing was impressive to say the least. I have seen cases where the juicing cased gastro intestinal problems and people were actually losing nutrients. It is always a good idea to talk to your fathers doctor to get a referral to a nutritionist. I read research day in and day out and the conventional wisdom is a balanced diet high in vegetable content is the best bet. Broccoli does show promise in research, check it out. The key in my humble opinion for all of us cancer survivors or not is clean water, clean food, clean air and exercise. Be aware that people are dead because they decided they could beat cancer with unproven alternate therapy found on the internet. Some alternative treatments may have a place in your fathers treatment but always make sure to discuss them with your fathers doctors to make sure they don\u2019t interfere with his conventional treatment path.\n\nThe changes to the dna in the bladder lining that allows the cancer to grow started many years ago maybe in his youth, cellular changes is the reason that bladder cancer has a high rate of reacurrance. Some people have a noninvasive tumor get it popped out and never deal with it again clean check ups are the norm. Many doctors see low grade nonivasive bladder cancer as being a nuscance cancer and for many it is as easy as that. Low grade can take years to grow as you said but low grade is the key. Once you get into high grade you are dealing with another beast entirely. Grade tells you how quickly the cells divide, stage tells you how advance the growth is. Now low grade can reacure and stay low grade or become a higher grade. That is the reason you have to stay faithful with your checkups.\n\nI wish your theory that just getting TURBS over and over if needed was the answer and for some it may be. But when you get into high grade that is not the case. For many with non invasive high grade or even low grade with multiple reaccurances BCG a non active form of the TB virus or other agents are instilled into the badder and has been found to be in many cases effective. If that does not work Radical Cystectomy has proven to be life saving for many.  I myself was diagnosed at 48 with invasive high grade bladder cancer. I was terrified of losing my bladder and chose to take part in a bladder sparing protocol using radiation and chemotherapy. Even during treatment the cancer returned again and again and was fast growing. If I had not had a Radical Cystectomy 12 years ago I would not be sitting here today. I live a good full normal life in every way, it was not easy but sure beat the alternative. My point being there is no one size fits all easy answer here. Research is not a bad thing in its self but your first line of defense has to be a Urologist that deals primarily in urological cancers that you trust to set a treatment plan that fits your fathers situation.\n\nThe reason I replied to your post was to remind all of us that this is a very complex multifaceted disease that people have studied for a lifetime and still do not have all the answers. We can not hope to find the answer on the internet it is not there. Again your first line of defense has to be a Urologist that primarily deals with bladder cancer that you trust.\n\nGood luck and keep us informed.\t\t\t", "date": "2018-04-22T20:01:34+00:00", "topic": "If a tumor recurs, do doctors perform 3rd TURBT?", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tYou need to contacts your fathers medical team.

The places he tumors that came back were probably seeded and ready to grow when the last TURBT was done. The thing with non invasive is keeping a check on it and making sure it does not become invasive.\nA lot of people have trouble with a catheter but he have to remember that it is for a small amount of time. They do not always have to use a catheter following TURBT it depends on how much has to be done. There are ways to make the catheter more comfortable during BCG please talk to your urologist they can use a numbing jell and also can give your boyfriend something for nerves prior.\nIf your boyfriend is having trouble with drug abuse he will need to be willing to seek help. His anger at you is probably his anger at the situation and his own inability to handle his own fear. But he has to be willing to seek help before things will get better. Some of what you have said makes me believe that he may not really understand bladder cancer. Some people hear cancer and think it is a death sentence and that is not the case with non invasive at all. Non Invasive bladder properly treated just become a fact of life for most survivors just like any condition such as diabetes or high blood pressure. Let untreated all three can have a bad outcome but with proper treatment life goes on. He has to understand that if he does not seek treatment and keep this in check that the discomfort of this will seem small once his choices are out of his hands.\nIf your boyfriend will not talk to you is there someone he trust that could talk to him? How about having him post here we will be happy to listen and share experiences? We all understand that being told you have cancer is a shock we have been there done that. Anger and depression can be a very normal reaction for some. I really think if he understood his diognisis better it might help with the stress. Many of us have found that we needed therapy or marriage counseling after our diagnosis but he has to be willing.\nNothing breaks my heart more than seeing someone die because they could not pull themselves together and fight when they are dealing with a situation that could have had a very different outcome. Hopefully he will get to the place he is in and reach for the help he needs to move forward he has a lot to live for.\nHang in there we are here for you.\t\t\t", "date": "2017-05-16T14:24:09+00:00", "topic": "Looking for advice", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tI would suggest taking this a step at a time.

People with septics do a couple of loads of laundry a week all the time and do not float their systems, it is a a question of volume. Following BCG most people have urgency and frequency. I can remember having to go every fifteen minutes or so on the first day as treatment progressed. At a cup at a time a gallon of bleach could be used or more in a day. If you did that every week for six weeks it could have an impact, particularly if you have an older system that is not that healthy.\n\nIf you live in a house with more than one bathroom it is a good idea to say that this is my bathroom for the day and clean the heck out of it before anyone else uses it. If not clean before someone else uses it.\n\nBottom line I do not know of anyone catching anything from someone undergoing BCG but you have to be careful to keep it that way.\n\nAnd as far as septic systems go,talk to a septic professional and ask them how much bleach is too much bleach and what you should do regularly to maintain it to keep it healthy.

It's cost has steadily increased in the last year and the reason is unclear. There is some speculation as to one companies accusation cost and the cost increase happened as BCG availability was limited. Compounding these cost increases is the fact that Medicare part B has set a limit to what it will pay meaning health care providers are losing money as they are paying more for it than they are being repaid.\n\nHere are a few articles that talk about drug shortage and costs. This is not a new situation and is a tangled web that has to do with drug liability for generic drugs, cost of production, limited number of companies producing the products do to reduced profitability of generic drugs, aging facilities, cost of adhering to FDA regulations.....and the list goes on.\n\nThis situation goes far beyond bladder cancer every year there are hundreds of drugs on shortage lists many of them used in the treatment of cancer. Sterile injectable's are at high risk of manufacturing failure, as are biologicals compounding the impact to our community. This situation has been intensifying since the early 2000's and some headway is being made but far from enough. The solution will not happen overnight but know that there is enough light on this situation that the powers that be know it is not going away.\n\nAUA Drug Shortages and Price Increases\n\nwww.auanet.org/press-media/drugs-for-urologic-conditions.cfm\n\nHealth Affairs Drug shortages driven by complex market conditions\n\nwww.healthaffairs.org/healthpolicybriefs/brief.php?brief_id=124\n\nNow having said all of that how does this information help you? It tells you that you are not the first or the last facing a problem with needed drugs being caught in the system making them cost prohibitive or unavailable.\n\nThe first thing is to find out if your insurance will pay for it through a compounding pharmacy. You said you had gotten a second opinion from MSK have you asked them about costs and availability at their facility? Have you asked them if there might be an alternative to Mitromyacin due to the cost?\n\nI know this probably doesn't help you solve your problem. But I wanted to give you an answer that told you that you were being heard. I know you are frustrated as are the cancer advocates that have spent years pounding on doors.

As they are the major producers of BCG in the world at this point this has caused problems and major worry for non invasive bladder cancer survivors.\n\nMerck has began production and shipment has resumed. They will be filling back orders and it will take a while for production to return to baseline and the pipeline to be back to normal.\n\nThe above is the best answer available at this time and comes from  Merck. The truth is that BCG is only one of hundreds of drugs that are in a state of shortage at any given time in the US. This is due to  many factors, manufacturing glitches as well as economic reasons.\n\nWe have seen shortages in the past this is not the first nor potentially the last. BCG is a biological and because of this the manufacturing of it can be impacted by many factors. Also it is an old drug no longer under patent and demanding the wildly high prices of new drugs on the market. Even without speculating on other factors it answers the questions of why more company's are not manufacturing it and why do we see shortages?\n\nOn a personal note I hear the reasons and understand them but can not help thinking that the FDA would be in panicked problem solving mode if the drug in question was Viagra. Can you imagine the press that would get? Call me cynical.\n\nThe bottom line is this, if you feel your treatment is being compromised by the BCG shortage it is time to talk to your Urologist about alternatives. If your Urologist is not converse in what is available seek a second opinion from one that specializes in bladder cancer at a major cancer center.\t\t\t", "date": "2014-08-24T03:03:33+00:00", "topic": "BCG shortage?!", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tMike, Sorry you have to be here but welcome.

We really need to see a lot of research into BCG to clarify the amounts needed and rhythm of treatment. But one of the take aways people get here about doing BCG is should be this. Your odds of winning the battle using BCG are vastly improved by being informed enough to have conversations with your medical team in order to miss the land minds. I have been through both BCG and systemic chemotherapy. BCG wears on your minds with so many facing you and it tends to get worse with progression, and there are worries about the infectious potential and it gives you some days of being tired and for some real fun times camping in the bathroom. In a word I found BCG wore on me after a while. But on the upside the worst part for me was having it to look forward to nothing was ever as bad as my mind made it by the time it was time to go again. Feeling bad for me unless there was a problems only lasted a few days. If someone asked me to give one word to describe BCG it would be tedious...........

I have been in contact with Senator Kerry's office of MA and talked to his aid in charge of health issues. I read her the conversation you had with Sanofi about holding back the drug due to cost issues. She has asked me to send her this thread as she would like to see it. She informed me that the President has just issued an executive order dealing with the shortages of drugs and that the FDA is looking into how to best deal with it. There is also legislation that should be passed this summer dealing with it as it is attached to a funding bill that has to be passed. However the proof will be in the pudding as they say will it change the situation?\n\nMy question for MGH or any institution providing BCG treatment is why they are not  turing over every rock looking for a substitute?  If Sanofi is shipping in early May did they have any idea when you could have treatment?\n\nI know this is not of any help to you and I can understand the stress this is putting you under. I personally feel that if any company is found to be withholding drugs due to cost considerations that they should be held liable for any damages emotionally or health wise their actions cause.

And when that happens I try to explain that they are not faulting where you are receiving treatment is it just that you could be dealing with a major cancer center but it is not considered to be a center of excellence in bladder cancer.  Part of what we do here is to always suggest strongly that a second opinion be sought at a center that handles a very high volume of bladder cancer and an Urologist and possibly if applicable an Oncologist that specializes in bladder cancer.  Many Oncologist, Urologists and Pathologists handle many genitourinary forms of Cancers and they may handle blc but their practice may heavily consist of prostate cancer. Whereas the treatment you receive where you are currently going is probably right on target it is wise to seek out a reality check with someone that only deals with a high volume of bladder cancer.  It is also suggested that you have your pathology slides reviewed at a center that does a very high volume of bladder cancer.  Pathology is as much of an art as it is a science and a center such as USC/Norris, M.D. Anderson or Hopkins will see more bladder cancer biopsies in a month than even a major cancer center that is not center of excellence in blc.  They will take a look to see if proper margins were gotten in your original biopsies and that they agree with the grade and stage. We know from statistics that as many as 40% of bladder cancers are misgraded sometimes with very tragic results.  Remember when dealing with this forum that people are just trying to help and they have seen horror stories of people that did not receive optimum care or were under graded from the start. They are not saying you are not receiving proper care they just want to make sure you have the information to make an informed decision about your care.\t\t\t", "date": "2009-05-07T21:10:43+00:00", "topic": "Markers or grades or levels", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tI was able to send on more information to this lady.

Because of this the site does not truly reflect the reality of blc, if treated correctly and monitored the vast majority will do well in the long term.  It also points out why we as a community need to stick around once we are past our own crisis to support the ones that come after us. Hearing from others that have walked the same path and are doing well is worth more than all the statistics in the world.\n\nAnother email was from someone dealing with non invasive blc. They felt that if they posted about their concerns and fears that they would be wrong when so many others were dealing with so much worse.\n\nBLC has many paths and each of us have our own story.  Yes most of us can not even imagine how we would handle what some are dealing with here but that does not diminish that for us all blc takes a toll. No matter what your stage or grade you still have worries and concerns that are real. You still need to talk of your fears and have a need for good information and need the validation of others walking your path.  When you post about your treatment side effects, your concerns or ask questions you become a blc advocate.  Most of the people that come here are dealing with non invasive blc and if they don\u2019t see themselves reflected here they do not get the support they need.  Hearing the C word in any context is terrifying, treatment dictions confusing at times, treatments are uncomfortable and have side effects and living between rechecks wears on us all. We are a community dealing with different situations but someone else\u2019s more advanced diagnosis does not diminish the challenges anyone faces with a diagnosis of blc.\n\nI also received an email from someone that hesitant to post because they did not know if posting was always appropriate.\n\nIf it is a subject you have dealt with it is always appropriate to share your knowledge.  But if you are a woman dealing with non invasive for example posting in the men\u2019s issues to a post about erectile dysfunction that you hope they do well and things start looking up\u2026\u2026. it may not be the thing to do. Or if you have never had the need for systemic chemotherapy but post that your grandmother did for breast cancer  ten years ago and you would rather die than have it personally\u2026..it may not be the thing to do.  If you wish to send someone your good wishes, that is always welcome and can be done by clicking on their avatar next to their post and going to their profile and sending them a private on site email or by posting directly to the post if it seems appropriate. It is always appropriate to give someone encouragment when they need it. There is only one category that is reserved for a specific group to post to and that is the metastatic survivor\u2019s discussion group.\n\nWe are a community that share a common concern but are dealing with a very diverse disease. Our challenge here is to give validation and support to all that come here no matter what their situation with blc.\n\nYour thoughts?\t\t\t", "date": "2008-07-28T16:47:50+00:00", "topic": "Posting concerns", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tIf you have not already done so I would also have your pathology slides reviewed by Sloan.

It has different agents and protocols but I know that at MA. General Hospital they have been doing it for over ten years plus. I personally went through the clinical trial there for bladder preservation .04-.05, consisting of forty trips to radiation and twenty to chemo. using three different drugs including the one mentioned here, over a nine month period. The first round of chemo. could be called chemo lite it is to help the radiation work. The second was systemic chemo to get any stray cells.\nNow the pros and cons. While there are good numbers as far as those that complete the therapy who retain their bladders the question of what the numbers are in the years to come are not as clear. I was one that completed the trial with my bladder intact but lost it less than a year later through repeated recurrence. There are also other issues such as radiation damage to the bladder itself causing inconstancy issues as well as neuropathy from the chemotherapy. Also after radiation most Uro surgeons are very resistant to doing any type of diversion other than an external appliance. So for the ones that do bladder preservation who never see a recurrence and do not have side affects it is a heaven sent. For those it does not, it leaves them with a whole new set of problems that they would not have faced if they had gone directly to RC. The day they can predict who will do well and who not will be a pivotal day in the protocol. The bottom line is that there is no free ride in the bladder cancer game yet.\n\nChin up and straight forward\n", "date": "2007-12-29T23:46:27+00:00", "topic": "Bladder-Cancer Sparing Treatment", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tGood luck with your recheck and good work you deserve it cancer is not for sissy\u2019s.

You will know much more once you talk to the doctor on Friday. A lot will depend on if there is a re grading or if it will stay the same T1 Gr 3 pathology.  I think one thing that is universal with anyone with a new cancer diagnosis is we desperately want absolutes. We want to hear that if I do x that it will take care of the problem. What we hear instead is if you do x it should take care of the problem.\nA T1 high grade diagnosis comes with differing paths of therapy depending on the wishes of the patient and the doctor\u2019s opinion. Many will decide to go with tumor removal and one of the treatments that are given directly into the bladder. Using a catheter inserted threw the urethra; they drip in an agent that ideally will cause an immune response in the bladder lining. This is done on a schedule and often yearly maintenance if there is no recurrence.  BCG is the most common one that they use but there are other agents. Most of these agents while they can cause side effects such as irritation of the bladder and frequency of urination will not cause the side effects commonly associated with systemic chemotherapy.  While in the minority from my knowledge an other might say no I want rid of this and I feel the surest way to do this is Radical Cystectomy.\nAs for can it comes back after Radical Cystectomy the answer is yes, cancer can be unpredictable. But the survival rate following radical Cystectomy is very high. Can it come back following treatment with BCG or a like agent while trying to preserve the bladder, yes it can bladder cancer has one of the highest rates of recurrence of any cancer. The goal of the BCG treatment is to preserve the native bladder, cut down on or eliminate recurrences and to try to keep any recurrences to a lower grade if they happen. Either course of treatment will mean that your father will frequently be checked for the rest of his life to catch problems as quickly as possible. There are people I know that have chosen either path and are doing well years later.\nI hope this helps a bit but know that you are going to a very good place for treatment. Sloane Kettering is well respected in the blc world.

They have pathologists that look at more blc in a week than a local pathologist will see in a year. Pathology is part science part art and depends on the experience of the practitioner. A good percentage of the time it will come back with a report that looks a lot like the one you are holding. It is insurance to make sure and worth the piece of mind. All you have to do to send the samples is call and get the information at Anderson as to who and where to send it and then go to the pathology department of where you had your TURB done and sign a paper giving them permition to send it and then tell them where. Make sure that everyone knows who gets the results. That would usually be your Uro. I will usually write out what I wish done print it and leave a copy.\nAs for the mitomycin talk to your Uro about it now and let him know that you wish it done if you have another TURB. If he is not using it ask him why? There is good evidence that it does help cut back on reseeding. But it is very expensive to use and can have some side effects so not all Uros use it even the best of them.\nYou are doing the right thing making yourself an informed medical consumer we are our own best advocates.

Yes if you are having to catch that often I imagine it is causing wear and tear on your stoma. And I know what the frustration is like when you are leaking. But take a deep breath it takes patience and perseverance but maybe this may hold some of your answers. It is possible your problem maybe that you have either an irritation of the bladder or an over abundance of mucus. I don\u2019t know your specifics or if you already know all of this but I will tell you what I know.\nI was diagnosed in \u201804 and had my radical cystectomy in \u201806, I also have an umbilical Indiana. I had my surgery at the University of Chicago Hospital and my Uro is Dr. Gary Stienburg.\nNow for the leaking, it can be caused by different things. I know a lady who has had hers for 20 years with no problem unless she eats Chinese food. She figured out over time that it is the MSG if she stays away from it she is fine. Mine can be caused by a few different things as we will talk about. The first I would imagine you have already checked on and that is an infection. Food interactions are probably less likely to be the culprit but it is possible. I have found in the summer if I drink to much lemonade the acidity makes my bladder rebel and leak. Also if you are diabetic high blood sugar can cause leaking so making sure that they are well regulated is important.\nAnother thing that can cause leaking is mucus. So lets talk about mucus oh joy. When your diversion is new mucus is normal over time it diminishes to only a little when you pouch is happy. It also is almost the perfect medium to grow bacteria so you don\u2019t want an over abundance of mucus staying in the bladder any longer than you have to. I was taught to do was to flush my pouch to break up the mucus and to flush the bladder itself of any possible irritants. See if you can set up an appointment with your doctor for them or their nurse to show you how. Also if you have insurance with a prescription it may pay for your supply\u2019s. It is a simple to do using a irrigation syringe fill with 50cc\u2019s of sterile normal saline, you then insert the tip of the syringe into the funnel end of your catheter and inject the saline into your bladder  try to aspirate it back into the syringe if it is not doing so easily just remove the syringe and allow the saline to drain out the catheter. I was told to do this twice a day and once the mucus decreased to do it once a week or as needed.\nSo this is what I do if I start leaking. If I am leaking every two and a half hours I would back up to every two hours and start flushing my pouch, add time between catheterizing until you are back to normal. I would also make sure that I was eating and drinking things that are none irritating. Pure water is important and the least irritating remember garbage in garbage out. Remember you can have your favorite spicy food once you are on track but once irritated the bladder is not very forgiving.\nNot all Uro\u2019s teach pouch training after RC but mine did and this is what I was told to do. Once all the tubes where gone and I was direct to catheterizing, to start at two hours and to add a half hour a week if adding a half hour causing leaking try adding fifteen minutes or less if you have to and do this until you reach three and a half or four hours. This is a long haul but worked well for me and I was continent by the sixth week. I found that having a timer or an Alexa or that type of thing helps a lot especially at night.\nI to this day I have outbreaks of what I call pouchitus meaning my pouch is irritated and training, a none irritating diet and retraining is my answer. By the way I am sure you know that finding something to keep you dry with a umbilical Indiana is hard but I have found male pads made by Tena work for me. Have you found anything that works for you?\nHopes this helps and I am here if you want to ask more questions or just to vent.\n\nCynthia\t\t\t", "date": "2020-01-21T19:56:42+00:00", "topic": "Bladder Spasms w/Indiana Pouch", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tAs someone who is still enjoying life after a 2004 bladder cancer diagnosis I of course can tell you yes it was worth it.

First as you already know flying with normal saline in you carry on does not work. I have always put it in checked baggage but only a couple of bottles. I like yourself make my own but of things such as flying I get a prescription and buy the labeled sealed bottles as that is important they probably would have a problem with an unlabeled bottle of liquid. And form what I am told they screen luggage coming on the cruse ship. So you need to make a few phone calls. One to your airline to find out what they way about liquids you need for medical treatment, they cruise line for the same question and your doctor to ask if you can use bottled water or not and for a prescription and possibly a letter stating why you need the saline. As for the alcohol I perchance the small bottles of hand sanitizer and throw them into my luggage, be careful to chose the ones that are alcohol only and not other ingredients. When I travel I use disposable catheters. I always keep in my pocket if I fly a regular rubbles catheter when I fly in case I am separated from my luggage. And if I can I mail my supples to my final destination if I am going for a few weeks.\n\nThose are just my thoughts will you let us know what you find out please it could help others that face the same question?

But if it makes you feel better I have gone to sleep two nights in a row with you on my mind.\nLet me give you some back round for what is a long story I will leave out the drama as I am sure you can fill in the blanks. In 2004 at 48 I was dxed with T2b high grade TCC and CIS my local Urologist who did three to five RC\u2019s a year had me scheduled for an RC with external appliance before even discussing it with me. I had already made an appointment with the team that pioneered the bladder sparing protocol at MA General. You see like you I was terrified, there had to be a better way I would rather have died than lose my bladder.....yada, yada, yada..... I was told I was the perfect candidate and off we went 40 trips to radiation and 20 to chemo, I lost my hair twice, went into menopause and had a lot of tests procedures and multiple TURB\u2019s. I started in the fall and ended in the late spring. By August I was bleeding heavily and had another TURB and it was black this time they tried BCG during the BCG I formed new tumors at that time I had to make a decision it was going to be my bladder or my life. It ends up when push comes to shove your bladder is a small price to pay for the rest of your life. I buried my Father at 10am and went into surgery the following morning at 6am for a radical cystectomy.\nNow before I say what I will in this paragraph let me prefix this with the fact I do think there is a place for bladder preservation in select cases, particularly people who can not tolerate an RC.  I have known other people who have been through the protocol and only one who retained their bladder long term. Where as this is not a scientific study I have never found statistics based on long term results they are mostly on who made it through the protocol itself not on the years that come after. The one thing we all have in common is the damage the radiation has done long term. If I have one regret it is the radiation, they health problems I have are not related to the RC they are related to the radiation and extensive chemo. In my case that is intestinal and stomach problems and the due to the radiation I had a bleed of the lower spine that caused nerve damage in my left leg and hip. Even after years of physical therapy due to this I can not walk longer than a block or two without my hip muscles going into spasm so I now own a super charged scooter that could win a drag race at the nursing home if need be.  Since chemo I have trouble maintaining magnesium and have a who list of drugs I can no longer tolerate. I could go on but you get the idea. Yes it might work but if it does not you may not have a choice of any type of diversion but an external appliance as most Urological surgeons do not feel that it would be advisable due to the damage the radiation has done. I had to move to another city for six weeks to find a surgeon that would even try and know that at the end I might have to revert to an appliance if it didn\u2019t work out. Plus I have now had all the pelvic radiation I could ever have and chemo choices maybe limited due to the agents I have already had if I ever need it.\nHaving said all that no matter what you chose to do we as a group will support you in your decision.

What you are dealing with does not fall within normal bladder cancer protocol as it is a different animal. The type of chemotherapy and treatment you will receive will be different than someone dealing with what we normally see here. I also looked and could not find a support network that would better serve you online I would assume that is due to its rarity. Having said the above know that even though we may not have specific information for you we will do the best we can to offer you the support you need.

I have an Indiana myself it was born in 2006. I had the opposite problem from yours mine was so tight there were times I couldn\u2019t get the catheter in. I had to have a surgery and they did a procedure loosening it. Leaving me with an Indiana that will leak if too full or if I have pouchitus. Over time I have learnt to deal. Before we go any further what ever I say here talk to your medical team about, after all I am not a doctor I\u2019m just a crazy lady on the internet. Since you did not tell me if you had tried anything to alleviate your leaking I will tell you what I do if I am leaking like a sieve.\n\nIf I start leaking it is usually from pouchitus. That is a catch all phrase that means your pouch is irritated for some reason. This is just an opinion and I know of no other source but my own observation. Anything that would upset my intestinal track can upset my pouch. Mucus build up can also be a reason. There are other times but rare when I can find no reason. Most often it is probably a number of things so if I have a problem I go back to the basics.\n\nOne of the things you can do for your pouch when it is irritated is to irrigate it. While the cathatur is inserted you insert the tip of an irrigation syringe into the funnel end and inject about 50cc\u2019s of normal saline and let it drain out or have you doctor teach you how to draw back on the syringe to pull it back out. I do this once a day while the pouch is upset and once a week otherwise. If this is something your doctor wants you to do they will need to give you a persiription for disposable syringes and the saline solution.\n\nWatch what you eat. If you are hitting the lemons and the vinegar or broccoli or what ever you triggers are cut back on it. Acidic things and anything that might cause digestion problems are a good place to look. I know a woman who has had her pouch for over 20 years and if she gets into MSG she will leak like a hose. So what bothers you might be different from someone else.\n\nIf all else fails I go back to the beginning and retrain it. When I left the doctors office with my catheters they also gave me instructions for training my pouch. At first I had an indweling cathather and would clamp it and then drain it. Then the cathater was removed and I finished training it by direct cathing. The way I was instructed to do it was to catheterize ever two hours for the first week week then add a half hour a week until you reached 4hrs. If you get to the say 4hour mark for example and find that you leak consistently at 3.30hrs  go back to 3:15 for a week and work forward in 15min increments. The idea is to stretch the bag by adding volume a little at a time. If you have a indwelling cathater talk to your doctor about clamping the catheter for say an hour and then work up in 15 min increments. I know my safe zone depending on my fluid intake is about 31/4 to 31/2 so I try to catheterize about every 3hrs.\n\nI use a few thing that have been a big help to me I am not endorsing any one model or make, I use a Alexa Dot she is the least expensive and it is great to be able to just verbally tell her to set a timer for every two hours during the night, I also have been told that an Apple Watch or a model that can set a timer would do. Also the only thing I have found that works as a pad to catch urine from an Indiana is made by Tenna and are called male guards, if you know of others let me know.\n\nI have no idea if any of this might help you I know what works for me but again crazy lady on the internet. Talk to your doctor if there is anything new to you here. I know how frustrating leakage is I am sure we could trade stories but I have \u201cfor the most part\u201d made peace with my pouch using these methods. I am sure I could go back and have another surgery to try to adjust it but I no longer do elective surgery on general principle so I decided ok was good.\nAnd if you just need to talk I am here.\t\t\t", "date": "2019-03-10T19:23:03+00:00", "topic": "New Indiana Pouch - defective valve", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tOne day at a time my dear just keep your eyes on getting to the end of your treatment.

I have had a lot of chemo and there are a few things that can help in my experience. I will share them with you on the agreement that you use them to frame questions for your medical team. Never take advice from strange ladies on the internet without talking to them.\n\nTake your nausea meds before you need them and keep them in your system as prescribed. Waiting until you need them makes it harder to get on top of it.\n\nNever let your stomach get empty as it can exacerbate nausea. I always kept a pack of crackers in my purse and a small can of juice.\n\nIf medicinal cannabis is legal in your state talk to your medical team about how to be certified as a patient if you are interested. It does not have to be smoked there are several delivery methods and the right strains can help a great deal. It can help deal with nausea, lack of appetite, aches and pains, lack of energy, not being able to sleep and others. The people working with the dispensaries are knowledgeable and should be able to help you.\n\nTalk to a nutritionist about you nutritional needs. We all know what foods work for us when we are nauseated but if you have no appetite things can get complicated. They should be able to help you with suggestions and help you understand your dietary needs during chemo. I was told to up protein intake among other things. I craved chicken breast and spinach to the point I couldn\u2019t face it for about two years after chemo. Chocolate milk was my friend.\n\nGive your self permission. To take a nap, to not take care of others problems, take a long bath or let someone else do the laundry. People will want to help let them you can help them back later. Exercise as allowed and as able even a short walk is better than none. Self care right now is very important.\n\nCommunication is MANDATORY as you go through chemo. Don\u2019t let anything go I can assure you that cough will not get better by tomorrow as a general rule.  If you can\u2019t eat you will get weak and healing will be harder. This is a case of having a still upper lip is not a good thing. You are part of the team and they can\u2019t do their work if they don\u2019t know. Ask who you should call if you have questions and keep the number with you.\n\nIt is a journey every day will take you closer to getting better. But the road from here to there is going to have bumps. Chemo is cumulative for most of us and we will feel weaker as the doses go by. But the good news is with in a few weeks of finishing chemo I was getting back to normal.\n\nLosing your hair if you do is traumatic, you know it is going to happen you think you are ready but. Decide now if you want a wig or if you want to wear hats. I had both but the wig was hot so I preferred the hats. You need them it is surprising how cold you get until the hair grows back. My hair was gorgeous after it came back in unfortunately it went back to normal.\n\nI have been to infusion twenty times. My best advice is to keep on top of the small thing health wise so they don\u2019t get big, cut yourself a lot of slack and keep you eyes on the prize.\n\nLet me know how you are doing and we are here if you need us.\t\t\t", "date": "2018-09-25T21:28:36+00:00", "topic": "MVAC side effects", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tThat\u2019s very nice of you.

I have had a bad cold and am late answering you I hope this is not to late. I had my bladder removed in May,06 and my life is pretty normal. I remember dancing at a friends wedding in August so I guess I was pretty back to normal by then. It is a big surgery and you should have someone to give you a hand when you get home. It was probably six weeks or so before I started feeling like myself again. There is pain but they took care of it pretty well with medication. Getting up and moving after surgery is a big help, as soon as they let you start walking do. Another thing start with simple foods as your intestines will thank you.  I think the one thing that helped me above all else was how I looked at it all. The surgery was a way to be well again to put my cancer behind me, so I told myself everyday was one step closer as I healed.  I never took my eyes off of getting to the other side of wellness. I hope this helps a little bit and please ask questions if you have them I will try to answer quicker.

My pouch is nine and I also have leakage at times. Remember all that I tell you is for you to take back to your doctor, trust them before a crazy lady on the internet. This all comes from my personal and others shared experience. It can be caused by one of a few things.\n\nPouchitous - This is an irritation of the pouch itself.\n\nThis can be caused by several different things. Diet can be the cause if something bothers the intestine it will often bother the pouch. I know one woman that every time she had Chinese food she would start leaking. Trial and error told her that she leaked everytime she had something with MSG.\n\nI personally find that if I have intestinal problems I have pouch problems. Once they resolve my leaking resolves.\n\nOver abundance of mucus. This can also be linked to food. Trial and error is the best thing here a food diary may help pinpoint.\n\nHaving said all of that if you have no idea what is causing it and that can be the case here is what I have found helps me. I go back to basic training, by that I mean get out the alarm clock and keep to a schedule. If I notice that I will leak after three hours I start there if it has no periodicity I start at 2 hours day time three night. Add an hour a week until you reach normal cathing for me that is every 4 hours.\nAnd I irrigate with 50cc of normal saline using an 60ml irrigation syringe, the tip fits perfectly into the end of the catheter. I was taught to draw back on the syringe to a get back flow. Again before trying this talk to your doctor also you would need a prescription for the normal saline the 60ml sterile irrigation syringes can be perchused on Amazon if need be.\n\nAs for the pad I use when leaking. I use the Tena male gaurds, they are in a V shape. My stoma is in my navel so I am able to use them wearing what I call granny panties, the correct term is high waisted brief. I also have a really bad adhesive allergy so I understand where you are with that. If that would not work I think if you had a close fitting belly band made and used a heavy duty urine pad with adhesive on the fabric side might work for you.\n\nGood luck and let me know what you figure out.\t\t\t", "date": "2017-08-05T04:48:20+00:00", "topic": "Indiana pouch leakage", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tGabe,\n\nEveryone's first reaction is to get it out now. The question you are asking is best discussed with your medical team. Tell them your fears and ask if they are founded. There are studies that show a small survival advantage with doing chemo prior to surgery but what percentage of study perticicpents mirrors your exact situation is always a good question.

I have an Indiana and I am not sure what your surgeon has against it. Doing what I do I talk to a lot of the top urologists and I do know that it depends on what you do the most of a lot of times. I talked to three of the top Urological Surgeon's in the country when I had my RC done. I knew I wanted an Indiana pouch if possible a neo was not possible because of cancer spread to the ureathia and I did not wish to have an external applicance. Having a continent diversion was important to me as I was very active if not as active as you are. The first surgeon did not do Indiana's but would do one if I insisted, the other two had had a lot of luck with them and would do one unless they found something unforeseen during surgery. I chose the one that did the highest volume of RC's and as an added bonus he was someone I liked and trusted.  Bottom line what every diversion you have the surgeon needs to do a high volume of them.\nMy experience with the Indiana has been great it is contenent and I catheratise about every four hours. I can honestly say that it has never kept me from doing what ever I wish to do. I have hiked, danced, snorkeled and lived life for ten years with it. At first like the neo it takes time to \"train it\" but once that was done it has been fine. I just have to plan to have a disposable catheter with me while out but that is what pockets are for right? If you have specific questions please ask I would be happy to answer.\nWe have a user I want to post to you but we do not seem to have his correct email address he check in every few days so I am sure you will hear from him soon as he checks in regularly.  He has a neo is a business owner and race care driver.\nWe have seen mountain climbers, marathon runners and everything in between with all three diversions. People adjust and adapt and that is an important piece of this puzzle another is the skill of the surgeon with the type of diversion they have done.\t\t\t", "date": "2016-11-18T04:36:06+00:00", "topic": "Surgery questions", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tI am sorry you have to be here but welcome to our community.

A honest conversation with her doctors about the options and thier ramifications are in order here. Some of the questions I would ask if I were in your situations would be.\n\nIf she does not wish to have surgery or chemotheropy are there other treatment options?\nWould surgery without chemotheropy be of benefit? What are probability that a Radical Cystectomy without chemotheropy could be curative?\nWould a schedule of surveillance with tumor removal and BCG if needed benefit her potentially?\nIf she chooses not to have further treatment what is the prognosis and possible timeline?\nIf she has a Radical Cystectomy and her memory problems increase would she need full time help?\nIf she decides to not pursue further treatment what steps can be taken to give her the best quality of life?\nIf she decides to not pursue further treatment would she be a good candidate for hospice care and if she what would the time table be to start.\n\nThe truth of the matter is there are no good answers some times we can only do the best we can while keeping in mind what her wishes are.

You are getting a handle on the information out there on the two diversions you are looking at but you asked about happiness with choice so I will share with you what is known and what I personally think after many years of dealing with survivors. A gathering of people with diversions was once asked to list the best diversion in thier opinion almost across the board they listed the type they had. What ever you have you will learn to deal with and it will become just a part of your life. I know that seem impossible right now but that is how it is with most of us. The people that are given the choice of thier type of diversion are usually happier with the outcome. That makes since as while having the diversion was not by choice you do have some choices and emotionally that may make it easier. Lifestyle is something that can make a difference in your choice. Many golfers come to look at the external bag as a great thing because they can get in more golf without stopping.

First off as for the stage and grade I am glad that you asked for your pathology report. Where as the best pathology can only be done after the Radical Cystectomy many times it will remain the same and it gives you an idea of what you are dealing with. T2 is stage two by the way the same as I was diagnosed with ten years ago. Here is a link to our page that will give you some more reading on grading and staging.\n\nbladdercancersupport.org/bladder-cancer-help/information/staging-and-grading-pathology-bladder-cancer\n\nIf you are not getting treatment at a center of excellence for bladder cancer you might want to think of a second opinion. Experience in the type of diversion you are receiving is very important in outcome. For example the local Urologist that dxed me did not give me any choice in the type of diversion he offered. He also did not think that it was important to preserve nerves for sexual function. He did a few Radical Cystectomys a year. The Doctor who did my RC did three to five a week and I have a diversion that works much better for me than what was offered locally. We had a conversation about preserving sexual function prior to surgery and I was very relieved that he was very aware of the issues with nerve sparing in both men and woman.\n\nI know right now you are in shock but take a big breath this can be done many of us have been where you are now and have came out the other side.\n\nKeep us updated and ask questions we are here for you.\t\t\t", "date": "2015-09-20T07:57:31+00:00", "topic": "Help", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tSorry you have to be here but welcome to our community.

I was having one procedure or another ever since. Finally about four months ago I was down to my last 18 teeth and went to see a specialist at Mass General Hospital was diagnosed within minutes with an extreme type of dry mouth caused to losing salivary glands during chemo. All he could offer me was a referral to another specialist at Tuffs or a medications with many known side affects. On the heals of this was the news six more needed to come out.

While not the first line of treatment for muscle invasive bladder cancer it is used in very select patients (no P53 over expression, single tumor of expectable location, no CIS) and the elderly.  After full removal of the tumor they use radiation and low levels of chemotherapy and a longer systemic chemotherapy regime following full response in the clinical trials. In the elder they often use the low level chemotherapy and radiation after full removal of the tumor.  Here is a link to the most current trail.\n\nwww.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00238420?term=NCT00238420&rank=1\n\nThere is much written about bladder cancer treatments in the elderly if you Google that term you will find many results such as these. Doctors are many times trying to balance quality of life and the person\u2019s tolerance for standard treatment when dealing with the elderly patient who has bladder cancer.\n\nwww.medscape.com/viewarticle/540087\n\nwww.asco.org/ascov2/Meetings/Abstracts?&vmview=abst_detail_view&confID=54&abstractID=20545\n\nWhile taking low level chemotherapy I was told that it might thin, fall our or stay the same and I have talked to people who have experienced any of the above and it also depends on the drugs used so ask. Tell your Mother that I have lost my hair twice to chemotherapy and both times it came back and was nicer than it was before. Unfortunately like baby hair it went back to normal but was nice while it lasted. I also noticed while I was bald that I given the best seats in restaurants and was once upgraded to first class while flying without asking so there are benefits.\n\nIf you do not feel at ease with the treatment path that has been suggested you of course should seek a second opinion to see if there are other options.\n\nWe are here for you and will try to help if we can please keep us updated.\t\t\t", "date": "2011-08-28T20:50:09+00:00", "topic": "Mom was diagnosed w Muscle Invasion Bladder Cancer", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tPatricia's Story\t\t\t", "date": "2011-06-29T19:38:10+00:00", "topic": "Patricia\\'s Story", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tKathleen-Ts Story\t\t\t", "date": "2011-06-29T16:55:20+00:00", "topic": "Kathleen-Ts Story", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tAll is well back home and trying to catch up on work.

This has happened to me right after it was made, if I have an infection, surgery on it or anything that causes the bowel to be affected that is systemic such as an antibiotic. I have also been told that certain foods can do it to some and they found help through keeping a food diary. Once inflamed it can take months for it to recover fully and if it keeps getting upset without fully healing it takes every longer with every set back.

Could the physical trauma you have been through be causing a chemical imbalance? I have no idea if there are answers to what you are experiencing but I do know that a time comes to either light a candle or curse the darkness it is a personal choice.

They did the procedure on Wednesday at noon and I got back to the room around three and fell asleep. I slept until six in the morning on Thursday with only getting up long enough to get a drink, do flushes and take medication. I got up and headed home from Boston and it was a long haul as I was so very tired.  Got home ate and fell asleep again until seven this morning.  I would assume as I have slept 26 out of the last 44 hours that I may have been exhausted.  Today I am not bright eyed and bushy tailed but feeling more like myself.\n\nThe good news is that they were able to get through the blockage in the ureter.  I will not be able to turn the valve so it empties into my pouch until my urine runs clear there is still some blood coming through.  It was interesting as when I got there they told me that they had talked to the Urologist and were going to do what they called a rosebud coming out of my stoma so that the urine could empty into a external pouch.  They seemed to forget that I have a navel stoma and that because of that the external appliance would not work well. I was also alarmed about what would happen to my Indiana if it was abandoned for weeks on end. After much discussion it was decided to go through the kidney and ureter and to allow it to drain into my pouch. I will let you know how all of that works once I am able to throw the switch.\n\nAnother interesting note is that I would have told you that there was no pain involved with having a neph tube installed this time I am having some post pain I can only imagine that is due to them doing it twice so close together.\n\nThank you all so much for all of your caring. I am going to lock this thread in a little bit as it is getting so long and start a new one.

I failed the clinical trial and had to go to RC less than a year after finishing chemo. I had trouble during that year with keeping certain mineral levels up in my system.  Calcium, Potassium, and Magnesium being the worst this was the first time I heard about the kidney damage from the chemo.  I even ended up in intensive care for three days due to the levels dropping so low. My kidney function was off but not to the point it was critical until December of last year. I showed up for my usual CT with contrast and was told my function was too poor to do the contrast. By the end of February I went in to have my left kidney removed due to it being damaged by a blocked ureter.  I now have added to my collection of specialists a kidney guy. I was very shocked to find out that I am considered to be in stage three kidney failure.  I can\u2019t change this but my first questions where what does this mean long term and what can I do to make sure it does not get worse?  A no salt added diet, keeping my blood pressure in line as well as my diabetes became even more important. I still struggle with my mineral levels but time has taught me how to deal much better and they have not gone critical since my kidney removal.\n\nI have a full and happy life and do all the things I have ever done. Yes I have to be careful and yes it is another thing to deal with and yes someday I may end up on dialysis. Do I get depressed when something new like this comes up health wise sure I do but I know I have to pull out of it and go on and deal with it that is what we do. I have a blc friend who is younger than I am that has lost both kidneys to blc following her RC.  She does home dialysis, works, cares for a young child and exercise regularly.

She was always worried about head lice and such and knew how to handle the proper cleaning of them. Other sites have had trouble with people exchanging used medical items as they would sometimes be already open or past their expiration date. Also there is the issue of some things only being available by prescription being transferred to another person. They also have had problems of people expecting money for things or who handles the postage.\n\nHaving said all of this I am very aware that not everyone can afford everything we need while going through treatment.

Available were social workers and nutritionists.\nBesides that I had my appointments weeks ahead of time so I knew what was going on at all times.

My room was shared unless I was having a bad day then I had a private room with a TV and it was very pleasant.

It is easy for the health care professionals to give you advice and it is good advice, but they can not possibly know how the thought of losing your hair makes you feel. I was in a clinical trial that lasted nine months and lost my hair and as it was coming back in started chemo again and lost it once again. I look back on that time and it is a distant memory now and all behind me. My hair came in curly and thick but as time has gone by it has gone back to being straight as it was before but is thicker than it was. Go now and buy a wig take a girlfriend and try a lot of them on find one you like. If you always wanted to be a blonde or a redhead this is your chance. Buy synthetic not real hair as they look great and take less care and are far less expensive. Buy scarves and hats as you may not always want to wear the wig and believe it or not your head will get cold. Keep your hair through the holidays ask them what course of chemo they usually see hair lose and do it before then. I waited until it came out and have no idea what the easiest way to do it is.

I know as a personal fact that as caregivers to our parents that you can talk until you are blue in the face and they are going to do what they want to do. Would your father allow you to go with him to his next appointment? One of the things I would ask his Urologist is if he does email. Some doctors are finding that it is a time saver for them as they can answer routine quick questions without having to see someone. If he does not do emails ask him what he would suggest to make communications work well between him and your parents. If they do not want you to be that involved it leaves you in a place where you can only support and be there for them. And yes I know how hard that is been there done that.\nYour other question was should your father be checked out after the trouble he had with his tubes? I would think it wouldn\u2019t hurt as from what you said it was a placement issue.

Depression is I think a reasonable response it seems sometimes. The problem is if it becomes chronic and effects recovery and desire to move forward.\n\nIn most cases you could talk to him about what he wants but if he has withdrawn from you that is not an option. But the truth of the matter from my expericance has been that once you get al the information from your doctors your way forward will become much more clear.  At that point maybe with solid facts your husband will feel more like looking at his options and talking.\n\nYou are between a rock and a hard spot, your only wish to is to help, your frustration must be off the chart.

The hospice staff helped us with medical equipment, staff for care and knowledge including how it was to be paid for. I am sure you have talked to them about your choices as a family as far as staying home or going into a care facility.

One thing to remember is that it progressively wears on you not only physically but mentally as well. I don't imagine anyone navigates cancer without facing depression at some point or the other.\nAnother is the fact that chemo suppress's the immune system. I was very alarmed when you said he had bed sores. Infection can be very dangerous and open sores are a very real concern in this case.\n\nPlease with a capital P talk to your health care team tomorrow. Let them know what is going on. Most people do not realize that they are doing themselves a disservice during chemo by keeping a stiff upper lip. Your team has to know what the side effects are. If they lose someone to infection or a blood clot from inactivity due to fatigue it defeats the purpose now doesn't it?\n\nThere are things that can be done. When I was in chemotherapy I had a social worker who kept tabs on me to make sure I was not having any practical or emotional issues that might effect my treatment. I also had a physicians assistant and could have had palliative care to help with side effects if needed. I had a dietitian who help make sure my diet supported my treatments. A support team is important to what you are trying to achieve. Some places offer them some places you have to ask.\n\nI know that you may not wish to have others in your home but a visiting nurse service, physical therapy or even temporary hospice might really be the key to making this work better. More chemo isn't going to make him any peppier. The more eyes you have on the situation the better especially if they are experienced eyes. They may be able to suggest little things that make a big difference.\n\nI hope that you don't feel I am being to forceful in my opinions but I am worried and know that with the right help this could be easier for you not to mention for your husband. I can feel your love and concern for him he is very lucky to have you in his corner.\t\t\t", "date": "2015-10-10T21:50:24+00:00", "topic": "Fatigue or depression?", "subforum": "7-metastatic-bladder-cancer"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tI am sorry we are not doctors here.

Never let your stomach get empty, if you do you will get sick every time. Always keep a pack of saltines and a juice box with you.\n\n2. If your nausea meds are not working talk to them about taking them proactively. I found starting before the nausea was the only way for me.\n\n3. If you have any symptom a snivel a slight change in anything no matter how insignificant talk to your medical team about it! This is the most important thing we can ever tell anyone doing chemo. Your immune system is going to take a beating and a small thing can become a big thing very quickly if not addressed. Park stoic at the door this is not about complaining it is about giving possible critical information.\n\n4. At some point for most of us chemo does affect our memory. I was so bad at one point that a friend threatened to pin a if lost return to note on my back. It came back fortunately no better than before but for a while invest in post a note stock.\n\n5. Don't forget your need for extra protein your killing off cells and they need the right building blocks to rebuild. I craved chicken breast and spinach the whole way though chemo. I was just recently I could eat either again, chemo was over I turned green for years when I saw either.\n\n6. If they tell you that you will lost your hair go ahead and shave it about the time they tell you it should happen. Waiting is like water torture and upsetting when it finally happens. I lost mine twice and tried waiting the first and the second I just did it and it was much easier and neater.\n\n7. Like BCG the side effect can be cumulative, rest when you are tired eat even if you don't want to, exercise when you can. Cut yourself some slack it is hard sometimes but the reality is that this is one time in life you have to put yourself first and take really good care of you.\n\nI wish I could tell you that the first day I walked in ready to kick cancer in the butt. But I can't the first day I was really afraid, the second day I was ready to kick butt though.\n\nI will be down in Boston for my regular check up Friday but I expect to see a post from you telling us how it is going.\n\nYou will be in my thoughts.\t\t\t", "date": "2013-03-12T13:03:03+00:00", "topic": "Ready.....Set....", "subforum": "7-metastatic-bladder-cancer"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tFirst off I am really sorry you and your husband have to be dealing with this.\n\nAs someone who has been part of two clinical trials you have to know that I feel they are important. But remember clinical trials are often more about medical knowledge than for potential for cure or life extension. Having said that who knows, when there was a breakthrough someone was in that clinical trial. Just be grounded in the fact that for every one that sees results there are much more that do not.\n\nI would advise anyone thinking of doing so to ask the important questions. Know that the people involved need to recruit to get the job done they will not lie to you but you have to ask the questions often to get the answers. Clinical trials are about gathering information not about your treatment needs per-say and are often paid for by drug companies. It is your job to make sure that it is in your best interest to take part in it.\n\nThe first question I would ask is what phase is this trial?\n\nPhase 1 trials are based on an idea and they are often checking for tolerance and dosage if it has potential they will progress to the next phase. If it is say a phase 4 trial ask them for results from the previous trials. A phase 4 clinical trial in other words might hold more potential than a phase 1.\n\nThe second question would be is this a blind trial? Some Clinical trials divide participants into groups. Some may get one drug others another or a placebo.\n\nThe third question would be what do you think the benefit could be to me if I participate? The answer could be simply to extend life a few weeks or months more.\n\nThe forth question would be what are the dangers to me. Could participation shorten my life or severely affect my quality of life?\n\nAs for consultations the only online one that does bladder cancer that I know of is MA General Hospital in Boston. Your are already dealing with some of the top now so that would not probably be of a lot of use to you. I would call MD Anderson and talk to them about reviewing your husband case. I have known cases where people were treated close to home using the protocol prescribed by a major center gotten through consultation. Also Anderson is a mecca for research and they would be a good resource in that way.\n\nNo matter what you do one of the most important things you need to talk to your doctors about is palliative care. Pain management and side effect management will play a very important part in your husband quality of life.\n\nHere is a link talking about palliative care\n\nwww.getpalliativecare.org/\n\nHere is a link to Clinicaltrials.gov information and a list of questions to ask.\n\nwww.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/search\n\nHere is a link to National Cancer Institutes clinical trial finder if you wish to look for other trials that maybe available.\n\nwww.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/search\n\nI hope I have not thrown to much information at you. I also hope that none of this seems to harshly put but this is a time you need the bottom line.  We are here if you have more questions or just need to talk.

During the preparation of the Christmas dinner I was eager to get involved but was banished from the kitchen.\n\nDoctor\u2019s orders are to have two complete weeks of rest and then slowly build up my walking and activities.\n\nIt has been confirmed that the tumour was a metastasis from the original bladder cancer from two years ago. The neurologist surgeon was very happy that they were able to remove the entire tumour. The plan of action now is to have preventative radiotherapy to zap any microscopic cancer cells that might be hanging around.\n\nStarting tomorrow they will make a mask for me that will be necessary when they start full brain radiotherapy on the 8th of January. Treatment will be 10-15min sessions for 10 days in total with a few days rest in between.\n\nPossible side effects from the treatment can be hair loss, tiredness, itchy scalp and nausea.\n\nI have been banned from driving again for 6 weeks which is when I have an MRI scan and neurology appointment to check the progress of the radiotherapy.\n\nI am so very thankful that the tumour was operable and that I have no further metastasis in my body which is very positive. My oncologist has said that because of this they are still aiming for curative rather than palliative treatment.\n\nThis will be my last update and for those that are interested to follow my journey through treatment I welcome you to follow my blog. I started a blog two years ago when I was diagnosed with bladder cancer which helped me greatly to express my feelings.\n\nThe initial diagnosis is the start of the blog and I will be starting to blog once more shortly a kind of part two to the journey.

Finally the day came that my Oncologist said enough he was worried about blood clots. Was I bummed or what I had only seven more to go and didn\u2019t really want to do it but what else is there to do when they say it\u2019s what you got to do? So into interventional radiation I went and got it installed. They gave me funny juice and there was no pain and then it was in. We still laugh about my escaping the nurse whose job it was to make sure that she turned me over to someone to take home (hospital rules).  You see I was staying at a hotel about a block from the hospital and my husband had to travel on business.  So my best friend was going to be with me but on my way to Boston she had called and was coming down with the flu. So here I was all alone now I don\u2019t usually lie but I hate being in a hospital any longer than I have to, I am famous for the ways I find to stay out of them. So when asked going in I told them my friend was with me but had gone to the bathroom. When I got done we walked out to the waiting room and my goodness she must have gone to get a drink. I told the nurse I would sit and wait for her and she said she would check on me in a bit. The minute she walked through the door you have never seen me move so fast. In other words getting it in could have not been that bad if I could move that fast and think that fast to escape the evil jail nurse.\n\nI went into chemo the next day and to tell you the truth I was scared to death of them tapping it the day after it was installed and the incision was so fresh. And guess what it wasn\u2019t bad at all and it got better every time after that. It made me wonder why I hadn\u2019t done it sooner it was so much easier than having them search for a vein over and over at times.

I remember one night my best friend while dealing with her Mom cried and said to me she just didn\u2019t know what to pray for anymore.  They are our parents keepers of our childhood, our hero\u2019s, our shelter, and it changed they now need us.  We may see the rest of the world through totally adult eyes\u2019 but with our parents\u2026\u2026 it is not so simple the emotions of the adult and child tug. And that is the way of the world it has always been that way between child and parent.\n\nIf you are conflicted can you imagine what your parents are feeling?  Everything has changed for them they see the end of their independence coming.  They are dealing with some very heavy issues not the least is their own mortality.  And I imagine like most of their generation they are doing it without therapy or support they don\u2019t talk a lot about it, they seem to just find a way to endure.\n\nYou are dealing with what many of us have or are dealing with as we get older; it is a very difficult journey to say the least.  I have likened to your kids turning 18; you have no say no say in their actions but somehow you pay for them one way or the other.  You will sleep with your hand half on the phone, dreading the moment when the other shoe will fall.  If you have a sibling to share this with it helps and complicates it of course; and if you have siblings you know what I just said. You will also endure because you have no choice you are on the train for better or worse.  But there will be minutes that you will never forget nor want too; make memories, say what you need to say to them and show them your love in small ways. We have found that what our parents wanted was for us to help them keep what was normal for them for as long as they could.

What follows is some of the best and most useful things I found during chemo and treatment.\n\nI had a backpack that held what I might need while at infusion. It was very nice as I didn\u2019t have to think about it just add what I might need that day and off I would go.\n\nAny of the drug stores carry mouthwash for dry mouth it can be a life saver during chemo by heading off mouth sores if used from the first. Hard candy is handy also for bouts of dry mouth.\n\nDuring chemo keeping a little something on your stomach is well known to help fight off nausea. Send them little snack packs to keep with them at all times. The hundred calorie packs are a nice size and offer good variety.\n\nSend a non perishable food gift basket to the hotel. Fruit is about as good for you as it gets.  Also your need for protein goes up during chemo so any good source that might appeal is a great idea. Note that cheese is good but that constipation can be a problem during chemo so with cheese and fruit for the opposite reason of course, not over doing it is a good idea until you know how your body reacts to it. Also ask about salt intake if you send processed meat.\n\nMy ipod was invaluable to me. If he does not have one and loves music get a MPS player and load it with his favorite type music. Chemo for the most part is a lot of tedium they come in hook you up and then you wait. It depends on the drugs, combinations how much hydration they have to give you and so on, for me it was five hours at least a visit. Playing cards, hand held games, books anything they might like to alleviate the boredom is a good gift.\n\nRecently a lady from my husband works was battling cancer and they sent her a gift for everyday she was away for chemo. One day it might be a nice bar of soap and a sea sponge, a candle, a pack of playing cards, a special chocolate bar. You get the idea, they were not expensive or big but they all had one thing in common, they were little comforts. A woman at work gathered them from everyone and sent them in one box; so that everyday she would have something to look forward to. I always thought that it would make a good family project, and everyone would feel they had done something; what a win win.\n\nTell them for their stay at the hotel to take a few little things that make it feel like home. A favorite pillow and a throw can mean a lot when you don\u2019t feel well and are away from home. If we were flying we would mail a box to the hotel and then use the UPS store to send it back. My husband would include in the box as it went out the return address stickers and tape to seal it up again.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nChin up and straight forward\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "date": "2008-05-26T13:32:49+00:00", "topic": "Chemo comfort tips?", "subforum": "7-metastatic-bladder-cancer"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tI live in W.

I saw your post earlier but I had to give it some thought. But lets go through this a step at a time.\n\n1. She should not have any problem getting supplies check with her insurance but they should pay for her supplies. She will get a prescription from her doctor and get it filled. Either she will find a local place or have it delivered mail order. I use a company for my catheters that is internet based and the preferred provider of my insurance, I give them a call about every three months.\n\n2. We have known people here that even did mountain climbing and race care drivers who had bags. I would say after a period of adjustment the bag will not in any way stop her from walking. As a matter of fact walking is the best thing she can do for herself as she recovers from her radical cystectomy.\n\n3. She will be adjusting to her bag as she recovers from surgery. The bag or appliance as some call it comes in a lot of configurations and finding the one that works for her may be a simple thing or a bit more complicated but it is doable. Ask her doctor is she can have an appointment with an ostomy nurse before she has surgery. This will give her a chance to meet them before she needs them and ask her questions. After surgery this is the person who will help her learn how to take care of her bag and stoma, her go to person on that issue. They together should be able to come up with a game plan for training and a good adjustment. As for urine escaping the bag that is the reason you work with the ostomy nurse to make sure this does not happen. But the truth be told it probably will happen a few times at first and there will be frustration but you have to remember that it is part of the adjustment.\n\nPeople adjust well to what ever type of diversion they get but with your MIL\u2019s blindness it will be more challenging.

Sorry this took so long but a stomach bug had me busy for a few days. It sounds like you have been through a lot with this whole thing. I was dxed in 04 and had a Indiana with an imbecile in 06. Everything was fine at first the normal growing pains training the Indiana but about a year I started having trouble accessing my stoma. I spent a lot of frustrated time trying to get the catheter in but it would finally relax enough to get it in. I was told to using disposable sterile catheters to start with a ten and insert it. After draining it clamp it off and tape in place and leave it changing it every time I cathed. In about a week to go to the 12 French and go another week and then go to a 14 French. I was also told to be on the lookout for a UTI as having a indwelling catheter will up your risk for one. I tried and I wish I could tell you it helped but about a month later I ended up in the ER and a young intern at our local hospital spent a few hours trying to access my stoma after I failed at home for hours. The resident called my surgeon and his resident and my local one strategized. Finally I we were able to get in and I drained over 1600cc\u2019s of urine. The problem that was worrying me was urine backing up into my kidneys and doing damage. About that time another problem started and I ended up with a neph tube from the left kidney as it was not draining properly and I had a raging UTI. I live in Western Massachusetts and my surgeon was in Chicago so off to Chicago I went. They had found something in my kidneys in the scans and the assumption was that the cancer had spread to the kidney so it had to be scheduled to come out. At the same time I felt it was time to address the trouble I was having with my stoma. It was decided that they could do a revision to it when they did the kidney to loosen it up. It ended up it was not spread of cancer but a very rare type of abcess that had formed in my kidney and they were able to do the stoma revision.\n\nSince they surgery in 08 the good news is that I have never had another issue accessing the stoma again. But the downside is that under the right situation I do have leakage. There were times I felt that I jumped from the frying pan and into the fire but time has been my friend in this. The first thing I found out was to keep track of how much I drank and how long I had gone between catheterizing. If I drank a lot of liquid I could be cathing every 2 hours or go the 4 if I didn\u2019t. I started setting my alarm on my phone for every three hours at night. I found a pad I could wear with my navel stoma (Tena Men\u2019s Guards) they are shaped in a V the wide part at the top and they work well if you wear a higher topped panty. Now eleven years out I it is not perfect but if I leak it isn\u2019t that often and I have learned the causes and try to avoid them.\n\nI know all this does not solve your problem but I do have a suggestion. The only surgeon I would trust to do a revision on a Indiana is one that does a high volume of them. Now this may describe the surgeon who did your original surgery but if it does not you need to get a second opinion. If you can let us know what state you are in we may have some suggestions.\t\t\t", "date": "2019-09-19T16:10:35+00:00", "topic": "Stoma Stenosis", "subforum": "10-women-and-bladder-cancer"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tI can certainly see that you have been through a lot.

I entered into a clinical trial to try to save my bladder received systemic chemo and radiation. The cancer returned non invasive this time and they did BCG and it returned again. By that time due to the radiation and BCG my bladder was useless I couldn't hold urine it defiantly effected my quality of life. Leaking urine did not make me feel sexy to say the least and I was concerned about how the surgery would leave me. I traveled to Boston, Baltimore and Chicago and talked to three of the best in the country as far as Radical Cystectomy goes. I chose to have an Indiana Pouch and went to Dr. Gary Stienberg at the Chicago University Hospital he does three to five RC's a month my local guy does about three a year.  There is an office there that helps people coming in from outside the area and they helped us find a temporary apartment. I talked to Dr. Stienberg about my worries we decided to leave my crevice and take my ovaries since I had already had chemo that threw me into the change. Because of anatomy the posterior wall of the vagina is affected by the surgery but the good news is that it is repaired and heals fine. I can honestly say that after healing and adjusting my life is normal sexually and every other way.\nIf you find a surgeon who does a lot of RC's you will have a choice of the type of diversion you have if your health is good and there is no spread of disease. The first type of diversion is the exterior bag it is the one taught to all Urologist and the one most often done because of that fact. The second is the Neo Bladder they use intestine and make a new bladder and hook it up to your original equipment. The Neo has to be trained before it is content and about a third of woman who have one are either hyper content or incontent but three quarters do well with it. The Indiana Pouch is done up to a point the same was as the Neo but the do a stoma and you use a catheter when you need to drain it. My stoma is in my naval and you would never know it was there but other people have the stoma on thier abdomen. I have a collection of make up bags I use to keep disposable catheters in my purse and other than having to plan for supplies when I traval I do not find it a big bother. There are pros and cons to all the diversions but most people find the do fine once they adjust.\nFor me my quality of life improved after RC I was once again content and was cancer free, able to move on. The important thing is finding a surgeon that does a high volume of the diversion you wish to have.\nIf you have any questions please let us know we are here.

The type of diversion one receives can depend on a lot of factors. There can be medical reasons such as tumor placement to name just one. Doctors preference can be another, all Urologist are taught how to do the Ileal conduit other types of diversion require further training and practice. Another is the patients preference, all things being equal medically ask your doctor about why he does not think you are a candidate for another type of type of diversion.\n\nThere are pros and cons for all type of diversions. I have an Indiana pouch I had all of your fears and an allergy to adhesives. I had to look for the right Urological Surgeon afrer talking to three of the best, I traveled from MA to Chicago Ill for eight weeks in 2006.  The thing about diversions is that you do not want anyone to do one for you that does not have a lot of practice. My local guy only did three to five llael conduits a year the one who did mine did three to five a week...true story. I had pelvic radiation prior the Radical Cystectomy and that made it harder to find the right person it might be easier for you, let us know what state you are in if you want to seek a second opinion. The point being if you are able to and you wish to look into other diversions you may have to get a second opinion.\n\nFor me a Indiana pouch has worked well. I have a stoma in my naval, use a catheter about every four hours. I find it convenient it is continent and if you didn't know me you wouldn't know I had it. I carry a makeup pouch in my purse with disposable supplies. I can honestly say it has not impacted my life that much. Yes there was healing and getting used to it but you do get used to it. And the same can be said with the other diversions. Some times we do not get to chose what type of diversion you get for the reasons I mentioned above, but we adjust. My Mom had a saying \"make the best of what you have\". There are ways of making an external applicance more sexy if that is imaginable we can talk about things like that when and if they become a consideration. That is what we do here trade information offer support.\nI hope this helps a little if you have questions ask away.\t\t\t", "date": "2017-01-21T04:59:40+00:00", "topic": "Asking for your experience", "subforum": "10-women-and-bladder-cancer"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tYou asked a question that was hard for you and you deserve as honest of an answer. For anyone that is easily offended by sexually frank discussion this may be more than you want to know.\n\nUnless we bring it up as woman sexuality and cancer is not touched a pone by our doctors.  The limited studies of woman and RC looking at sexuality show that as many as 50% have sexual problems following RC of one sort or the other.  And of course sexuality and chemo is a story in and of its self.\n\nFirst let\u2019s look at some of the factors that the RC brings with it.\n\nA.\tIf the back wall of the vagina was taken it can cause shortening of the vagina and make intercourse difficult.  Many woman need to use what is called a vaginal dilator and it takes patience and time to lengthen and stretch the vagina.\nB.\tThe onset of menopause due to hysterectomy.  This can cause vaginal dryness and lack of desire.\nC.\tA change of body imagine due to surgical scars, stomas or outside appliances.\nD.\tOur partners have a problem moving between the caregiver to the lover roles. They worry about hurting us, they worry about urine discharge.\nE.\tEmotional and physical fatigue from dealing with all the ramifications cancer brings to our lives.\n\n\nNow let\u2019s look at some of the factors that we face as woman sexually while doing chemo.\n\nA.\tLack of desire due to fatigue or feeling unwell.\nB.\tLack of desire due to menopause caused by chemotherapy.\nC.\tChanges in body image due to hair loss, weight gain or weight loss.\nD.\tOur partners are worried about us and often times have trouble moving between their role as caregiver and lover.\nE.\tOur partners are fatigued due to their expanded responsibilities during our treatment.\n\nNow here is the good news my partner and I have faced this and in the last two years came to the place that we now have a deeper intimate relationship than we did perhaps prior to blc. It takes patience on both parties\u2019 parts but with time can be done.\n\nHere are a few suggestions that worked for us and have been suggested by other woman.\nA.\tIf leakage is a worry empty right before starting.\nB.\tDon\u2019t place so much importance on intercourse for a while.  Exploring other forms of intimacy can actually add spice and intimacy to a relationship.\nC.\tI you suffer from vaginal dryness make sure that you find a good lubricant.\nD.\tWhen you try intercourse again even if the posterior wall of the vagina was not taken it will take some patience that area has been through a lot. Do not be surprised it takes a while to have success it is a matter of stretching.  Make sure that you have plenty of foreplay this is not the time for a quickie.\nE.\tIf you lack desire due to menopause many woman find that the desire may not be there but they still enjoy the act once they get going.\nF.\tSome women talk to their doctors about hormone replacement.  Have an honest dialog with your doctor about the benefits versus potential health complications.\nG.\t If body image is a problem lingerie can help a lot. Mae West once said that any woman should never let a man see her comply naked or in anything but candlelight. I took her advice as I have a continent umbilical diversion I would cover my stoma with a light day pad and wear a teddy.\nH.\tIf your partner is scared of hurting you give it time. Start by cuddling and pleasuring each other and take it a step at a time.\nI.\tTalk to your doctor about the possible need to use a condom during chemotherapy.\nJ.\tExcept that some of the problems we face during cancer treatment is situational and time is the answer. Once treatment is over and life returns to a more normal routine and the emotional pressure returns to normal things will happen in a natural way.\nK.\t If you don\u2019t feel like making loves during treatment find the energy to pleasure your partner. It is a loving gift that leaves you both feeling cared for and close.\nL.\tIf your doctor give an ok to a vaginal dilator some woman have found success obtaining one the same size and shape as the medical one in adult stores or online  that had the vibrating feature. The found this helped relax the muscles and increased feeling and sensitivity.  Helping make what could be a chore more enjoyable.\nM.\tA lot of us past the honeymoon phase forget how much fun necking was and need a refresher course in foreplay anyway this is a good time to start at the beginning.\nN.\tFor some this is a good time to seek couples therapy.  Find someone that has experience with couples dealing with serious illness.\n\n\nDon\u2019t be too hard on each other there has been a great shock to your relationship in many ways.  I know for us roles in some ways shifted and stress was incredible on many fronts. You are both scared while trying to do what is best for your children without a road map on how. The family pressures and problems that were there before blc do not magically disappear when you hear the C word. You are facing chemotherapy and that is an unknown to you.  This is very hard on relationships and everyone is just trying to find out what reality is again.  Yes no performance pressure here.\n\n\nI can only tell you how we got through it; imperfectly with a great deal of love.  Sometimes we puffed and sometimes we were in a huff, sometimes we said the right then and sometimes not and we forgave each other for being human. He forgave me when I was feeling so bad I forgot his needs and I tried very hard to remember them when I could. And through it all we held on to each other in a physical and emotional way. And one day we realized that we had made it through and the world was normal again or should we say a new normal but good.  Make sure that you both keep the fact that these are early days and one day treatment and healing will end and you will enter a new phase of survivorship.  Print this out for your partner and share it if you like he may be the strong silent type but I bet he would like to know that what is going on here is normal and you two are not reinventing the wheel on the fact that intimacy is complicated by blc.\n\nHere is the link to our woman and sexuality links page.\n\n\nbladdercancersupport.org/index.php?option=com_weblinks&catid=38&Itemid=103\n", "date": "2008-07-25T13:49:04+00:00", "topic": "Questions on Intercourse", "subforum": "10-women-and-bladder-cancer"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tMary, I hope that my story will help with your fears a bit. I did everything I could not to have an RC and lost sight of what was really important. I forgot that the war was to stay alive and not to keep my bladder. By the time I had my RC my quality of life was not great I had constant discomfort and was completely inconstant  but still I feared the RC. On May 3rd 2005 I had my RC with an Indiana Pouch done at Chicago Uniniversity Hospital by Dr. Gary Stienberg he does three to five RC's a week. (My local Urologist did three to five a year.) Yes it was a big surgery but five weeks later I flew back to my home in Massachusetts, was doing a conga line at a wedding in August and drove by myself to and from Tennessee to help my sister who had surgery in September. As a side note it was there that the first conference calls took place that lead to our founding this organization. I have danced, hiked, snorkeled and traval frequently it has not slowed me down. It has not been without complications or frustrations but you bull through because that is what you have to do. Today my diversion is just a part of who I am and I really don't give it a great deal of thought. I carry disposable catheters in my purse in a makeup case. I have noticed that in a public restroom that my girlfriends and I tend to finish up and hit the sink for wash up at that same time and if I didn't tell anyone they would never know. Life goes on after RC and you adjust. I tend to think that the IP is a great choice it is continent and convenient. I don't have to sit down on dirty toilets in gas stations and having to go while hiking is great now in comparison. I can look you in the eye and tell you that my quality of life is better without my bladder. This would not have been any of our first choices but with time it is amazing what becomes normal.

I had a time of it when I first started buying catheter supplies. I called around and only one of my local medical supply companies excepted my insurance so I went with them. They were a lot of help as they gave me samples of anything they had they thought would work and I found one I liked. This worked until my insurance no longer would pay the medical supply as a 'preferred' provider. They sent me to a company who is their preferred supplier that is online as is many this one is Byram medical supply and I know there are others. Now the interesting thing is that the catheters were a lot more expensive through them than my local place. I order them once every three months and get a 90 day supply other than storage this has worked well and there is not a lot of co pay. Call your insurance company and ask if they have preferred providers.  I use Aprogee 14Fr 16in straight/soft 1061 I like them as they are more pliable than many disposable catheters maybe other companies make a soft cath if you can not find these but the soft is important to me as they rigid ones are much harder to manage. Now you may be using a 12Fr or a 16Fr but this catheter is available in different sizes.\n\nAs for the leakage I would imagine you are \"flushing\" your pouch as directed. If they have not told you to do this leakage may be caused by mucus build up and flushing helps break that up. I was instructed to flush once a day for the first months using 50cc of Normal Saline. Then less frequently as time went on now after all these years I do it once a week or so or if I have leakage. Do as your doctors tell you of course.\n\nI also take a sanitary pad with the tape on the back and place it in my undies I have some high waist-ed ones that work well for this and just place it in the best place to catch any leaks if they happen.\n\nI hope this helps and I am sorry I have not answered sooner but have been busy with a lot of stuff this last week.

I thought I would reprint it here and that it might be of some help. I know some of it does not apply to you but I think some of it might.\n\nYou asked a question that was hard for you and you deserve as honest of an answer. For anyone that is easily offended by sexually frank discussion this may be more than you want to know.\n\nUnless we bring it up as woman sexuality and cancer is not touched a pone by our doctors.  The limited studies of woman and RC looking at sexuality show that as many as 50% have sexual problems following RC of one sort or the other.  And of course sexuality and chemo is a story in and of its self.\n\nFirst let\u2019s look at some of the factors that the RC brings with it.\n\nA.\tIf the back wall of the vagina was taken it can cause shortening of the vagina and make intercourse difficult.  Many woman need to use what is called a vaginal dilator and it takes patience and time to lengthen and stretch the vagina.\nB.\tThe onset of menopause due to hysterectomy.  This can cause vaginal dryness and lack of desire.\nC.\tA change of body imagine due to surgical scars, stomas or outside appliances.\nD.\tOur partners have a problem moving between the caregiver to the lover roles. They worry about hurting us, they worry about urine discharge.\nE.\tEmotional and physical fatigue from dealing with all the ramifications cancer brings to our lives.\n\n\nNow let\u2019s look at some of the factors that we face as woman sexually while doing chemo.\n\nA.\tLack of desire due to fatigue or feeling unwell.\nB.\tLack of desire due to menopause caused by chemotherapy.\nC.\tChanges in body image due to hair loss, weight gain or weight loss.\nD.\tOur partners are worried about us and often times have trouble moving between their role as caregiver and lover.\nE.\tOur partners are fatigued due to their expanded responsibilities during our treatment.\n\nNow here is the good news my partner and I have faced this and in the last two years came to the place that we now have a deeper intimate relationship than we did perhaps prior to blc. It takes patience on both parties\u2019 parts but with time can be done.\n\nHere are a few suggestions that worked for us and have been suggested by other woman.\nA.\tIf leakage is a worry empty right before starting.\nB.\tDon\u2019t place so much importance on intercourse for a while.  Exploring other forms of intimacy can actually add spice and intimacy to a relationship.\nC.\tI you suffer from vaginal dryness make sure that you find a good lubricant.\nD.\tWhen you try intercourse again even if the posterior wall of the vagina was not taken it will take some patience that area has been through a lot. Do not be surprised it takes a while to have success it is a matter of stretching.  Make sure that you have plenty of foreplay this is not the time for a quickie.\nE.\tIf you lack desire due to menopause many woman find that the desire may not be there but they still enjoy the act once they get going.\nF.\tSome women talk to their doctors about hormone replacement.  Have an honest dialog with your doctor about the benefits versus potential health complications.\nG.\t If body image is a problem lingerie can help a lot. Mae West once said that any woman should never let a man see her comply naked or in anything but candlelight. I took her advice as I have a continent umbilical diversion I would cover my stoma with a light day pad and wear a teddy.\nH.\tIf your partner is scared of hurting you give it time. Start by cuddling and pleasuring each other and take it a step at a time.\nI.\tTalk to your doctor about the possible need to use a condom during chemotherapy.\nJ.\tExcept that some of the problems we face during cancer treatment is situational and time is the answer. Once treatment is over and life returns to a more normal routine and the emotional pressure returns to normal things will happen in a natural way.\nK.\t If you don\u2019t feel like making loves during treatment find the energy to pleasure your partner. It is a loving gift that leaves you both feeling cared for and close.\nL.\tIf your doctor give an ok to a vaginal dilator some woman have found success obtaining one the same size and shape as the medical one in adult stores or online  that had the vibrating feature. The found this helped relax the muscles and increased feeling and sensitivity.  Helping make what could be a chore more enjoyable.\nM.\tA lot of us past the honeymoon phase forget how much fun necking was and need a refresher course in foreplay anyway this is a good time to start at the beginning.\nN.\tFor some this is a good time to seek couples therapy.  Find someone that has experience with couples dealing with serious illness.\nO.      Again foreplay is very important for a woman particularly in this case. The more aroused a woman is the more prepared the vaginal tissue becomes.\nP.      Position can make a big difference, missionary many not be the best to start with. Some woman find the being in a position such as on top can help a great deal. It allows you to control penetration and pace allowing you to relax and not worry that your partner will make a move that will be painful.\nQ.       If all else fails it is time to see a good Gynecologist that has a background in dealing with woman that have had surgery that alters the vaginal areas. There are creams on the market that can help with the texture of the vaginal wall among other remedies.\n\n\nDon\u2019t be too hard on each other there has been a great shock to your relationship in many ways.  I know for us roles in some ways shifted and stress was incredible on many fronts. You are both scared while trying to do what is best for your children without a road map on how. The family pressures and problems that were there before blc do not magically disappear when you hear the C word. You are facing chemotherapy and that is an unknown to you.  This is very hard on relationships and everyone is just trying to find out what reality is again.  Yes no performance pressure here.\n\n\nI can only tell you how we got through it; imperfectly with a great deal of love.  Sometimes we puffed and sometimes we were in a huff, sometimes we said the right then and sometimes not and we forgave each other for being human. He forgave me when I was feeling so bad I forgot his needs and I tried very hard to remember them when I could. And through it all we held on to each other in a physical and emotional way. And one day we realized that we had made it through and the world was normal again or should we say a new normal but good.  Make sure that you both keep the fact that these are early days and one day treatment and healing will end and you will enter a new phase of survivorship.  Print this out for your partner and share it if you like he may be the strong silent type but I bet he would like to know that what is going on here is normal and you two are not reinventing the wheel on the fact that intimacy is complicated by blc.\n\nHere is the link to our woman and sexuality links page.\n\n\nbladdercancersupport.org/index.php?option=com_weblinks&catid=38&Itemid=103\n", "date": "2009-07-08T18:37:48+00:00", "topic": "Is there intercourse after an Indy????", "subforum": "10-women-and-bladder-cancer"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tBJ,\n\nYou are not the first to have experienced this having said that I am not a doctor so of course talk to your doctor about it.

Also ask your Uro about irrigating while using a larger cath if you are having trouble with your voiding volume again. I have some 60cc irrigation syringes that fit perfectly into the end of the cath.

You might want to keep a food diary and try to see if anything you are eating causes an increase.

As for it being indelicate we talk about every body function in the world why should we shy away from this one? I think I was told it was ok to go back to relations when we felt ready after about six weeks. I also remember thinking I was not sure if I would ever be ready. It was a little like the first time after you have a baby. Rule number one is to take it slow. Rule number two is not to put yourself and your partner under pressure to make it right the first time. Honestly the first time for us we didn\u2019t get far with penetration but we did pleasure each other. I remember crying when I had my first orgasm as I think in the back of our minds we wonder if we will be able to or if it will be the same. Have you been using a dilator?  If you have you will have a good idea of what you can take as far as stretchability goes. Give yourself and your husband the gift of a good lubricant you can find them in the feminine needs area in Wal-Mart and any large drug store. I remember the first time we had intercourse and for months after I would feel a burn at first but as things went along during the event it would get better. A little like being a virgin every time for a while. We found that extended foreplay was mandatory. It will take patience and your partner needs to let you be in charge of letting him know what is ok and what is too much. Try new positions as you may find that one works better than an other. Also remember that you don\u2019t have to go for the main event the first time just try and if it doesn\u2019t work fully know that it is a work in progress and it takes time to stretch the vagina again. If at first you don\u2019t succeed\u2026\u2026.  This is a good time to explore other ways of pleasuring each other. It can be a gift of a sort as you worked toward stretching your vagina try not to be as focused on vaginal intercourse and you may find that your love making becames more adventurous and varied. I will be two years out of RC in May and we are now back to normal but it does take a while.\nI hope this helps and if you have questions please email me directly if you do not feel at ease posting them here.

I have an Indaiana Pouch it is like a Neobladder except I do not have a urethra but a stoma so I use a catheter to drain the pouch. Having said that please talk to your doctor about any suggestions I offer here. There are only two three things I can think to offer. Anything you can do to up your husband immune system as a whole is a good idea. Regular sleep, reduced stress and a balanced diet could help if they are needed. Talk to your Urologist about a referral to an infectious desease specialists. Now this one you really need to talk to your Urologist about please do not try this without doing so first. Some have found that irrigating thier Pouch is helpful, let me explain what that is in the case of a Neobladder. The pouch is made of is made of intestine and the intestine produces muchus to make thing keep moving along and that is a good thing while it is functioning as intestine but less so when it is a Neobladder. The Mucus is a good medium for infection to grow. Now as our pouches get older the thought is that they will produce less mucus and that is usually the case. But if for some reason I have found with mine if it gets upset it can start producing too much mucus again, if it does I go back to irrigating it once a day for a while.  In my case that means while I have the catheter inserted I use a irrigation syringe loaded with 50cc\u2019s of Normal Saline that I inject it into the pouch and then leaving the syringe in place pull back and aspirate the Normal Saline back out, bringing with it the Saline and any stray mucus. With a Neobladder you would have to first insert the catheter and follow the same procedure.

Following RC most people lose weight so that is indeed normal. Now as for the intestinal problems that varies from person to person. You don't eat following RC until the intestines \"wake up\" and then they normally tell you to eat what you want, and for many that works. It did not work well for me and others we have talked to on this forum. For some of us it is a little more complicated. And you are right I think it has a lot to do with the intestine being disturbed and needing to heal. Now what to do for us folks that have a bad time with our intestines. Start with the basics is always the best bet. Pretend you are a new baby being introduced to food and add things a bit at a time tend to work for many, bland is your friend. Also things that did not bother you before may bother you for a while. When I got home my husband thought he would do a nice thing and brought me my drink of choice, iced tea with artificial sweetener. It took me a few days to figure out what was going on but I thought I was going to die between the gas pains and running to the restroom.

To this day if I get into artificial sweetener here I go again.\nYou might want to talk to a nutritionist about dietary choices it does not sound like your husband needs anymore weight lose.

I upped the number of times I urinated I set a timer and went every two hours and made sure I emptied all the way.

Watermelon gets me every time I think it is a natural diuretic and it is just too much too soon.\nYou might like to keep a food diary and see if you can match up bad leak days with a certain food.\n\nYou might like to talk to your doctor about irrigating your pouch, I did it once a day at first. When your pouch is new and since it is made of intestine and it likes to make mucus as intestine do normally. You would need to get your own instruction but I was taught to use an irrigation syringe and 50cc of sterile normal saline. This helps break up stagnant mucus and allow it to drain more easily and is quick and painless. You would have to get instructions and a prescription for the saline and irrigation syringe. I now only flush about once a week as mucus production goes down with time.\n\nA bladder infection can cause leakage if you have not you might have that checked.\n\nEven when everything is going well for a long time you can get what is termed pouchitis this is when for some reason the pouch or sphincter gets irritated and will seem to at time spasm causing leakage. This will sometimes right it self with time but I find that again flushing usually helps.\nLast but not least is talk to your doctor he may  have some suggestions of the leakage may be a side effect of something you have not thought of.\n\nWhen my pouch was new it was so tight that on one occasion it took a trip to the ER and a few hours to be able to catheterize. A revision was done during a later surgery for a blocked ureter. The outcome is that now I have to be very careful or I will have leakage. I know by measuring how much my pouch holds when full around 400cc. So I keep an eye on my intake and know that the more I drink the more often I have to catheterize. Easy math, what goes in has to come out in equal measure and probably sooner than later. I was told that I would be able to go four or five hours, the truth of the matter is it depends on how much I drink. I am a camel and always have a tea or water next to me so there are days I cath ever two or two and a half hours.\n\nI hope this helps and if you have questions just fire away.\t\t\t", "date": "2014-10-05T16:56:10+00:00", "topic": "Indiana Pouch Leakage", "subforum": "6-men-and-bladder-cancer"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tJake, A Urologist who some have called the father of BCG named Dr. Donald Lamm has reported reductions of BCG being used with success.

Some are creams or ointments containing ingredients like lanolin or petroleum jelly that form a protective barrier on the skin.\nThere are also sprays or towelettes that cover the skin in a clear protective film but allow air flow. Remember that you still have to clean the skin after incontinence, even when using these products. Just reapply your moisture barrier after cleaning and drying the skin.\nFinally, there are a number of products available to treat existing skin rashes:\n\u2022\tHydrocortisone cream can be used occasionally to help soothe irritated skin. Follow your doctor\u2019s recommendations for use.\n\u2022\tPeople with yeast infection rashes (this may appear as skin areas that are bright red with surrounding bumps) can purchase over-the-counter creams that will treat these infections, but you should check with your doctor before using them.\n\u2022\tYou also might consider using an antifungal powder if you find that your skin is constantly moist. This can help absorb moisture as well as prevent fungal and yeast infections\n\nPS also some find that if they use a hairdryer on a low setting as not to cause burns it helps cut down on dry time when changing.

If the decision is made to enter hospice it is done with the hope of quality of life. My family has gone through hospice four times in the past years. Twice through the in hospital hospice here and twice through hiring in home. In its perfect form hospice will have a philosophy of care including pain management, help with mental health concerns, general compfort and even spiritual support if needed. There job is to help you make decisions that make sense for your family and helping them achieve them. Hopefully leaving you in a better place to support your husband and care for yourself as you go forward.\nIf you have more than one in your community make sure you interview more than one. They are not all created equal and some offer services or have policies that others do not.\nWe have found hospice to be very careing and pain control was a top priority as was compfort. They always tried to make sure that our loved ones were part of the process while being there offering support to the family. I think it takes the right type of person to work hospice and the nurses we worked with will always have my gratitude and admiration.\nAlways remember that if one hospice organization does not work you can always change. You also if your husband was able to go back to treatment leave at any time.\nFor our family the first two times we used hospice it was clear cut that it was the thing to do. After that it was earlier because we knew that there are people that have been on hospice for years and no matter what it would make the journey easier. Looking back it not only was a gift to our loved ones but to ourselves because we could not have cared for them as well without thier help.\n\nI know this does not help a lot but know I am others are here if you need to \"talk\".\n\nCynthia\t\t\t", "date": "2017-08-28T15:33:38+00:00", "topic": "Chemo no longer an option for my husband", "subforum": "20-caregivers-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tGlad things are going better.

During the fall and winter of 1991-1992 while living in Germany I saw a Belgian diet doctor. He was the talk of the American female community, it was the easiest diet ever the weight just melted away. And beside one of the wives I knew had her husband a doctor have it analyzed and it was only herbs\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\nThis is an old piece from Harvard it is about half way down this page at this link if you would like to read the whole thing.\n\nwww.health.harvard.edu/fhg/fhgupdate/N/N2.shtml#herb\n\nCaution Always Key in Using Herbal Medicines\n\nA recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine offers another important reminder on careful use of herbal remedies. This caution is rooted in the absence of strict pharmaceutical controls in the manufacture of such products and how the lack of these requirements can leave room for tragic errors.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, doctors at a clinic in Belgium treated 43 patients with end-stage kidney failure, requiring dialysis or transplant. Not surprisingly, these individuals had something in common in their medical histories. Between 1990 and 1992, each had used a Chinese herbal remedy in combination with two other drugs for weight loss. The herbal preparation supposedly contained Stephania tetrandra and Magnolia officinalis. But the sudden appearance of kidney failure in these patients caused their doctors to suspect that the herb Aristolochia fangchi, which is poisonous to the kidneys, had unintentionally been substituted for S. tetrandra. The Chinese names for A. fangchi and S. tetrandra sound similar and the two are often confused. Analysis showed that the herbal remedy did, in fact, contain aristolochic acids, which are derived from A. fangchi. Aristolochic acids cause cancer in rats and mutations in bacteria and mammals.\n\nReports of patients who had developed urothelial carcinoma (cancer of the tissues lining the bladder, ureter, and part of the kidney), as well as kidney failure related to the Chinese herbs, drew concern among the Belgian doctors. When one of their patients also developed this cancer, the doctors decided that all patients with end-stage kidney failure related to the use of Chinese herbs should be checked for cancer of these organs. By removing these organs, the doctors hoped to prevent cancer from developing in their patients. Thirty-nine of the 43 patients agreed to undergo the preventive surgery. Of these patients, 46% of them already had cancerous growths in the removed tissues. In addition, 19 of the remaining 21 patients had abnormal growths in the urinary system. The investigators also analyzed DNA samples taken from the kidneys and ureters of each patient. The DNA samples for every patient showed changes typically found after exposure to aristolochic acid. The researchers compared these results to analysis of DNA samples taken from eight patients with end-stage kidney failure unrelated to Chinese herbs. None of these control samples showed DNA changes formed by aristolochic acid.\t\t\t", "date": "2011-04-23T03:49:37+00:00", "topic": "Beware of those Chinese Slimming pills", "subforum": "31-articles-of-interest"}, {"text": "\nwww.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-04/aafc-aoc032511.php ", "date": "2011-04-06T19:46:09+00:00", "topic": "Avoiding or controlling diabetes may reduce cancer", "subforum": "31-articles-of-interest"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tI actually talked to a woman that is dealing with just that happening.\n\nI was stage 2 it was very aggressive and never had a positive cytology go figure.\t\t\t", "date": "2011-04-05T17:11:27+00:00", "topic": "Urinary cytology for the detection of BLC", "subforum": "31-articles-of-interest"}, {"text": "\nwww.urologiconcology.org/article/PIIS107814391100041X/abstract?rss=yes ", "date": "2011-04-05T17:11:27+00:00", "topic": "Urinary cytology for the detection of BLC", "subforum": "31-articles-of-interest"}, {"text": "\nclincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/early/2011/03/16/1078-0432.CCR-10-2770.abstract ", "date": "2011-04-05T17:08:40+00:00", "topic": "BLC On the Road to Personalized Medicine", "subforum": "31-articles-of-interest"}, {"text": "\nwell.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/31/the-rise-of-desktop-medicine/ ", "date": "2011-04-04T17:31:39+00:00", "topic": "The Rise of Desktop Medicine", "subforum": "31-articles-of-interest"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tRecognition and treatment of BCG failure in bladder cancer - Abstract\n\nwww.thescientificworld.com/TSW/TOC/TSWJ_ArticleLanding.asp?ArticleId=3894 ", "date": "2011-04-01T15:08:10+00:00", "topic": "Treatment of BCG failure in bladder cancer", "subforum": "31-articles-of-interest"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tPathological upstaging detected in radical cystectomy procedures is associated with a significantly worse tumour-specific survival rate for patients with clinical T1 urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder\n\nwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21388337 ", "date": "2011-03-31T16:36:40+00:00", "topic": "RC T1 and Pathological upstaging", "subforum": "31-articles-of-interest"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tRadical cystectomy for BCG failure: has the timing improved in recent years?\n\nonlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1464-410X.2010.09830.x/abstract ", "date": "2011-03-31T16:33:45+00:00", "topic": "Radical cystectomy for BCG failure and timing", "subforum": "31-articles-of-interest"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tStudy identifies gene that suppresses cell\u2019s immune activation\n\nI found this interesting even though this study was on prostate cancer.\n\nwww.nih.gov/news/health/mar2011/nci-23.htm\n\nGood explanation of what a Dendritic cell is\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendritic_cell ", "date": "2011-03-31T16:31:38+00:00", "topic": "gene  found suppressing cell\u2019s immune activation", "subforum": "31-articles-of-interest"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tPat that is the reason I post these without comment,discussion is very important.

But we are human and I can understand frustration and how much you just want others to understand the bigger picture and that we cannot let simple difference of opinion take us off course.\n\nThis is a case in point\u2026\u2026. People got frustrated and hurt. I have to take the time to field emails from people in support of Pat being upset. And I or someone will have to step into the void her not being here creates until other step up, that is time that we could have spent doing advocacy work, words can do harm even when they are just misunderstood.  I always spend a good bit of time fielding emails, some are upset that they feel they are being pushed too much to get a second opinion, others that they feel someone is playing a doctor on the internet without a license or that someone from anther organization is sending them private messages trying to get them to leave and use anther website, or that we are not getting as much done as another organization\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026sigh When you are dealing with the general public, some under a great deal of stress there will always be issues but we need to lock arms around the cause and try to over look our differences and go forward. This is not about competition between organizations, misspoken words or whose work is the most important it is about people\u2019s lives. The bottom line is we all want the same thing, we may not be perfect about it but we are learning and we keep trying.\n\nWe all have our jobs and the people that keep this forum going are very important.  As important as all our other work is this is where my heart is it reminds me why we are doing what we do and that keeps me going forward I need this forum as much as anyone else. But without all of us none of this works and I can only hope that hurt feelings will fade and the importance of the mission will take over again.\n\nPS: Lee I am with your wife it always makes me feel uncomfortable when someone tells me how brave I am when all I am trying to do is stay alive it has nothing to do with courage it has to do with survival.\t\t\t", "date": "2010-08-17T01:08:31+00:00", "topic": "Faces of True Courage - Psycology Today", "subforum": "31-articles-of-interest"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tWhile my husband and I tried to take a few days away from our work I have been following this thread. And after giving it some thought I decided to not step in and took a watch and see stance then it took a while to decide how to respond.\n\nWe are a community, a family and anyone who has ever been to a big family dinner will tell you not everyone sees eye to eye.  But they are family and have a commonality that binds them.  This site is about one thing, providing help and support to others that have been in our boat, hoping that what we do will make it a little easier for others that come after us.\n\nWhen I took over this forum when it moved from the Web Caf\u00e9 it did not take long before there was trouble and I already knew that fighting could destroy a forum. I have received a lot of criticism for doing what I felt was the best thing for this forum. I have even been told that some have left the forum because it isn\u2019t as much fun to read since we no longer allow out and out feuding.  However there is nothing wrong with not seeing eye to eye and voicing an opinion. We all have to never lose focus that none of us have anything other than the right reason for being here.  We don\u2019t have to agree we just have to agree that we have bigger issues here than any one of us or our opinions.\n\nIf you really think that we would intentionally do anything on this site that would create division please read our founding principal.\n\nwww.bladdercancersupport.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1&Itemid=87\n\nThe fact is that this is one place that it does not matter if you are a purple striped Martian who worships the three toed god Loony  you are welcome here as long as you are in need and respect others in other words we are all equal and of value. And I would be surprised if anyone could ever come up with one incident that would indicate otherwise.  And I would like to think that our community is stronger than one article.\n\nI know all the individuals who posted and all of them are to be respected for their work in bladder cancer advocacy, they are just coming at it from different perspectives.  It is going to take a lot of us with a lot of different skill sets to get the job done.  The ABLCS (pronounced abliss by the way) has many jobs as of this minute we have over 38 different projects somewhere in the pipeline, and not everyone is doing the same job so their priorities and opinions are set by what they are doing.  This is pretty impressive when you take into account that none of us are paid the only people paid are technical or professional in nature.  Sylvia knows how important this forum is and she has worked very hard to make sure the money is there to make it happen as well of having spent hours talking to me about how to make it better. What she meant was that this site alone will not get the word out by itself the ABLCS has to be more than this website as important as it is, it is only a part of what we must do.\n\nWe are not a wealthy organization we are only two years old and growing plus we started business at the worst time since the great depression and we do not have the money to do a major national awareness campaign.  And until we do we feel in a race to get the word out because every day someone potentially could die from ignorance.  Added to the lack of resources we are dealing with an information pipeline that does not embrace our cause readily.  We have been told by the marketing pros that we need a hook that our cause is not about subject matter that rings the media\u2019s bell.  We have had to find creative ways to get attention for the cause and we are getting better at it but we cannot control what they wish to write about. To tell you the truth I don\u2019t care what the article is about as long as it is factual and informs one person we have won.\n\nGeorge said we have gotten too politically correct around here and maybe is right. So if you want straight talk I will go first.\n\nI feel sometimes we are standing at a cross roads arguing not where we need to go but how we are going to get there.  What we need is troops on the ground, resources and our eyes on our goal.   If you do not think we are going in the right direction you are welcome to be a part of this if you have a skill or know someone who can help let us know. If you can give ten dollars a month to the cause please do or encourage a fundraiser in your home town it helps us keep afloat and get the word out.  It is time to lead, follow or get out of the way the ABLCS cannot stop it is 2010 and for the first time in history bladder cancer is just starting to be noticed. We need the people who post to the forum as well as people working in other areas to get this done, we are all important to our mission,  we can\u2019t take our eye off the ball for any reason the stakes are too high.\t\t\t", "date": "2010-08-17T01:08:31+00:00", "topic": "Faces of True Courage - Psycology Today", "subforum": "31-articles-of-interest"}, {"text": "\nwww.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/190325.php ", "date": "2010-05-29T17:04:47+00:00", "topic": "(Hexaminolevulinate HCl) Approved By The FDA", "subforum": "31-articles-of-interest"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tThey talk about one patient that is going to be 102\n\nwww.dana-farber.org/pat/patientprofiles/personalprofiles/addressing-the-needs-of-older-cancer-patients.html ", "date": "2010-05-11T23:21:03+00:00", "topic": "On Geriatric Cancer Care from Dana Farber", "subforum": "31-articles-of-interest"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tCancer has gone tech if you have an iphone you might be interested in these applications from askabout.com.\n\ncancer.about.com/od/copingwithcancer/tp/iphone_apps.htm ", "date": "2010-04-22T10:32:15+00:00", "topic": "iphone apps for people with cancer", "subforum": "31-articles-of-interest"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tAnn yes do read it.

From what I am reading in this case is that they are using smooth tissue cells. They are not growing bladders but the tissue they would have used instead of the intestine they harvest. This study is for the external appliance and is a first step and would of course offer the advantage of not having to touch the intestine and that is a first for any type of diversion that I know of for bladder cancer.

Dr. Gary Steinberg of the University of Chicago was standing in the room telling me of this new clinical trial they will be doing.\n\nTengion is a company that is working with growing tissue for different uses  from peoples own cells.  They have been working on growing Neo Bladders and have completed phase 2 trials for the use of  in children who have conditions such as spinal bifida in need of replacement and adults who have spinal cord injuries.  This offers the advantages of not having to use intestinal tissues.\n\nThey are now in the process of recruiting for a phase 1 clinical trial for people that are in need of Radical Cystectomy with bladder cancer. This trial will offer an Incontinent Urinary Diversion Using an Autologous Neo-Urinary Conduit. To my understanding this will be an Elliot Conduit done using tissue grown from your own cells so that intestinal tissue will not have to be harvested.

The technique nicely stratified patients for appropriate chemotherapy.This type of patient predictive system might also help to find new drugs. COXEN screening could enrich the pipeline.

Another organization is not going to raise funds for a different cancer even an organization for the same cancer would not do that.\n\nCase in point as far as misinformation and cancer fundraising. About a month ago we started getting requests for bladder cancer merchandise from people doing Relay for Life to put in gift bags. These people think that if they do fundraising for the American Cancer Society that some of the money goes to other organizations such as ours. This is not a fact at all not that what they do is not important. We have had to take a step back and ask ourselves if we could afford to do this and if it is the best use of our resources. We are trying to do what we can because it does raise awareness in survivors of this communities presence. But if we get too many requests we are going to have to say no because it could bankrupt us.\t\t\t", "date": "2010-04-20T02:36:07+00:00", "topic": "ADVOCACY..IT ONLY TAKES ONE", "subforum": "17-chit-chat"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tThe last few days there has been a lot written about bladder cancer advocacy on our forum. This site is done for survivors and the people that care about them by the American Bladder Cancer Society. Providing support through an online community is only a part of our mission. If you have not had a chance read our mission statement.\n\nOur Mission Statement\n\nbladdercancersupport.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1&Itemid=87\n\nThe American Bladder Cancer was started by a group of survivors and caregivers out of the same frustrations you have voiced. We are still frustrated our resources only allow us to do so much and our first priority was this website. The building and maintainace of this site represents tens of thousands of dollars and is an ongoing endeavor. We are now to the place we can look at the next part of our goals. We are seeking grant money and donation to support advocacy and awareness work. We firmly believe as you do that knowledge of bladder cancer can save lives. If you look at our logo you will see a small flower and the words Forget Us Not for we believe that bladder cancer is the forgotten cancer. Bladder cancer is a very misunderstood cancer by even the majority of the medical community. The only real money going into research for bladder cancer is by medical/pharmaceutical companies. Bladder cancer is the most expensive cancer to treat and as sad as that is it is the only reason there is as much research as there is. It is still one cancer no one wants to talk about and we do not have a famous voice to add to ours. The need for awareness of bladder cancer is critical every day there is more people that are diagnosed at an advanced stage that could have been spared that if they had even basic knowledge of bladder cancer and its symptoms.\n\nAs Pat pointed out there is power in numbers and the Komen foundation is indeed a case in point where one voice can grow too many and become heard. The dream of the American Bladder Cancer Society is to become that voice for bladder cancer. We hear your frustration and invite you to join us in your own way to reach our goals. If grant writing is your thing let me know if fundraising is your thing let me know. If you have an idea and need help achieving it let me know. No one wants to hear this but to achieve our goals we need money. If you work for a company who gives to non profits such as our let me know. If someone asks you what they can do to help tell them to do a fundraiser it does not matter if it is a small one or a big one, enough golf tournaments, runs and yard sales will save lives.\n\nWe can talk about what should be done forever but it will not get the job done. The American Bladder Cancer Society a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization has worked had to get the framework in place to go forward and give bladder cancers voice a home. We would like to ask you to move past your frustration and add your voice to ours until there are so many that we have to be heard. My contact information follows or just click the contact us link in the main menu.\n\nThanks for listening to my rant.\n\nPS Pat the color for bladder cancer is orange but we we looking at ribbons and bracelets the other day and thought  two colors might be nice. How about ABLCS Blue and Orange?\nAs for prostate cancer they are very well funded and have many organizations working for them the do not need our help.\t\t\t", "date": "2010-04-20T02:36:07+00:00", "topic": "ADVOCACY..IT ONLY TAKES ONE", "subforum": "17-chit-chat"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tWe are always working to improve the site and its function.

I have received some flak for doing this blog some have felt it was insensitive to people with breast cancer. Nothing could be further from the truth I have lost people I love to breast cancer it is a monster as is any cancer there are no good or better cancers.  But having said that I am a bladder cancer advocate and you would have to walk in my shoes to understand my frustration. People are dying of ignorance because they do not know the symptoms of bladder cancer and here are a few things I have heard over the years, I can send you more if you like.\n\nFrom an advertizing person \u201cBladder cancer isn\u2019t sexy enough you have to find a hook\u201d (You think you were shocked by cancer being cool try the sexy angle)\n\nWhen asking at the top national cancer organization if they had a flyer for bladder cancer I was told \u201cWe only do them for the major cancers.\u201d (Imagine the shock when I pointed out that bladder cancer was the fifth most prevalent cancer in men according to their own statistics.)\n\nWe live in a society that spin is all in the press and certain cancers have received the lion\u2019s share of said press for some time now for differing reasons.  The good news is that the powers that be have made the realization that because of the weight put on a few cancers that others are now under served. It is our job to see that the facts  become heard so that lives will be saved and the day will come that needless suffering is a thing of the past due to ignorance about bladder cancer by the general public. And hopefully with that awareness much needed money will go to more research into bladder cancer treatment and survivors issues.\t\t\t", "date": "2009-11-07T01:38:23+00:00", "topic": "How did a popularity contest become a part of cancer survivorship?", "subforum": "17-chit-chat"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tThanks for the kind words! The flu is a thing of the past but I had to do a UTI just to say I did. I did not write this to tell everyone that I had a bad life; nothing could be further from the truth. The reason I wrote it was that I think sometimes we need to share the fact that even though we have a chin up attitude it does not mean we do not have bad days. Often we tend to build holidays into a Norman Rockwell moment and they do not meet our expectations, and for some sadness and depression can follow.  The reality of the situation is that for most nothing is as perfect as we wish it were and it leaves us the choice of appreciating what we have or being upset for what didn\u2019t live up to our expectations.\n\nGeorge I think we could do a whole section here on what pets have meant to some of us during hard times in our lives. Sam the Yorkshire terrier had to be taken bodily from me to eat and go out when I was going through treatments and surgeries. My family thinks it is because he was worried about who would spoil him rotten if anything happened to me but I like to think it had something to do with love and loyalty.\n\nAs for a Thanksgiving that we still talk was one that had to do with the flu as well in 2004. As I was in the middle of chemotherapy and radiation the decision was made that this year we would eat out. I had made a reservation for the whole family at a nice area restaurant. We woke up Thanksgiving morning and Ed was very sick with the flu and was not up to going anywhere. Now the problem was that the others in the group were all of my in laws and not a one of them were under 80 not a problems in itself if you didn\u2019t know my mother in law.  Mary had never had a problem of saying exactly what she was thinking and at 90 she was hard of hearing and just said it louder. The only person she would ever behave for was my husband. Being a wise woman I knew I need back up so I called my 21 year old son and told him he had to take his father\u2019s place and after some threats about Santa not coming he of course graciously accepted. As we were being seated I said hello to the last person I wanted to see at the table next to ours a nasty business rival who I had over the years been very careful to only show strength and dignity. It was going pretty well and I had convinced myself that we were going to get out of there without major mishap. I excused myself to the ladies room and had no sooner returned than Mary looked and me and said in a voice so that everyone in the room could hear \u2018Go Pee?\u2019 I smiled and shook my head yes and thought well if that is the worst of it when\u2026\u2026.\u2019Nice wig\u2019 came out of her mouth.  Now Mary on a roll was a thing of wonder and she didn\u2019t disappoint once she got rolling. By the way my son could have been some help if he could have stopped laughing long enough.  To tell you the truth my dignity being dented didn\u2019t kill me at all and I still laugh whenever I think of it. I would give a great deal to have one more holiday wondering what Mary would say next.\t\t\t", "date": "2009-11-28T23:55:44+00:00", "topic": "Flu, the mashed potato war and Thanksgiving", "subforum": "17-chit-chat"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tI am very sorry I have not been around this week at all.

There is something about them that tends to bring out our emotions in strong ways both good and bad even when we are not dealing with the C word. If you are going through treatment, healing from the loss of a loved one or trying to deal with the uncertainty of the coming year it is at times difficult to know what to be grateful for. It can feel almost impossible to deal with a world that is decorated and celebrating when you do not feel like a part of it. For those in our blc family who will find the upcoming holidays hard may I wish for you the gift of hope? Hope that time will help heal losses, hope that treatment will be successful and hope that this community will continue to grow and support those in need.\n\nI thought I would share with you something I wrote at a time in my life that I really could not find much to be grateful for around the holidays. While sitting in the Oncologists office one day there was a man about my age sitting a few chairs away. We all have had situations where we did not want to eavesdrop but could not help it unless we left the area or put our fingers in our ears and this was one of them. The man was angry about his bladder cancer and he was taking it out on an obviously loving wife, the doctors and anyone else that could be blamed, bitterness his main focus. This was a turning point in my thinking on the subject of being thankful for the every day miracles that my life contained and here is what I wrote.\n\nMiracles\n\nOnce there was a grumpy ungrateful man. He was never happy\u2026\u2026\u2026..if it was sunny he complained that rain was needed. He never saw the beauty of the night sky because he was too busy cursing the darkness. He didn\u2019t have friends because they would take up to much of his time. He got rid of his dog because he ate too much food. His family was just too much trouble and always needed something.\n\nOne day this man became ill, and the doctors told him he had cancer and needed treatment. He complained that the nurses hurt him. He yelled at the Oncologists because the treatment made him ill. He became angry with his cancer support group because he didn\u2019t like what was said all the time. So the man gave up and he sent them all away.\n\nWhen the man died he found himself in a white room with a young man holding a clip board. \u201cHello\u201d said the young man \u201cI am with the Miracle Output Committee. We felt that we needed to talk to you, as you have sent back every miracle we have sent you and we wondered why?\u201d \u201cMiracles? I was sent no miracles\u201d yelled the grumpy ungrateful man.\u201d  \u201cAll I was sent was problems.\u201d  Immediately the young man said \u201cOh no you are very mistaken\u201d he started sorting though his paperwork. \u201cHere is the list of what we sent you and it is a very long one indeed.\u201d Reading on he said. \u201cAn intelligent strong mind as well as sight, touch and smell glorious sunsets, the beauty of a spring morning and the joys of nature\u201d and the list went on and on. \u201cAnd when you got cancer we sent you more miracles\u201d  \u201cWhen I got cancer all I got was trouble and pain, I saw no miracles, I am here aren\u2019t I?\u201d complained the grumpy ungrateful man. The young man looked at him with great pity and said \u201cThe cancer we did not send it just was. The miracle we sent you when you got cancer was one of our most wonderful miracles of all, the love of your fellow man.\u201d The young man was shaking his head sadly for he knew the grumpy ungrateful man could not see. \u201cWe sent family and friend to comfort and care for you. We sent you other cancer survivors that where willing to share your sorrows and joys.  We sent you advocacy groups working to make life brighter for all cancer survivors. We sent intelligent, talented people so filled with love for their fellow man that they dedicated their lives to them. Researchers to find a cure, nurses filled with compassion, Oncologists, Surgeons, and Radiologist with staffs to work tirelessly to help you. And through them all we sent you the greatest miracle of all\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026hope\u201d\n\nThank you all for being my miracles, and may this upcoming holiday season be filled with every day miracles and the gift of hope for each and every one of you.\t\t\t", "date": "2008-11-25T22:19:28+00:00", "topic": "A few thoughts on thanks giving", "subforum": "17-chit-chat"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tMel select reply to this messege then look to the bottom you will see where it says select image file to attach.
