Then came all my research (a lot of it via this great website) and then came information overload (reading stuff; getting three opinions from docs), etc.  Now I am calm and sorted out (most of the time).\n\nKaren & Rosemary are absolutely right.  Everyone should get a second opinion.  And since you are in NYC, you have access to some of the best in the country.\n\nMany people here (and elsewhere) have gone to Harry Herr at Memorial Sloan Kettering; he has written more papers and done more research on BC than anyone else and is recognized as one of top BC guys in the world.  And I have heard you can get in to see him fairly quickly.  He has a rep for no bedside manner and others have suggested two docs who work with him closely: Dr. Sagani and Dr. Rebanoi (sp?). But go get a second opinion, and then a third if the second varies greatly from the first.  But then you have to balance more info overload. Most insurance companies pay not only for a second opinion but, if it differs from first, will also pay for a third.\n\nAnd write down all your questions and bring them.  What works for me is that I type my questions, reread them and revise them, bring two copies to appointment and give one copy to the doc at the start of the visit.  I then take notes of answers on my copy cause after I leave I forget what was said.    The two docs I have done this with seem to appreciate being able to get right to my questions; saves them time.\n\nAnd if you can bring someone with you: partner, friend.  Two sets of ears are better than one.\n\nGood luck and focus on what you have control over, not what you do not.  (If only I could always take my own advice).\n\nStay on an even keel and good luck,\nDavid\t\t\t", "date": "2008-07-19T12:47:42+00:00", "topic": "In Desperate Need of Help", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tMe too!  \n\nJust home from uro and cysto and all looks good.

Could not get individual coverage once the BC was diagnosed in May 2008.  But CT is one of the most liberal states in defining a \"group\" as any entity of 2 or more persons so wife and I incorporated a 2-member LLC as \"consultants\" and have app pending with Anthem for group coverage.  Insurance companies must write coverage for groups without medical underwriting; rates based strictly on age based underwriting - so our rates are based solely on fact that we are in the age 55-59 cohort.

I'm 59/Male, live in CT and got the news in early May 2008 that I had a T1G3 tumor.  Had a TURBD. The doc that did the TURBD, who is well known and respected in these parts and is in a large urological surgury practice, says he got it all and wants me to start on the Lamm/SWOG BCG protocol.\n\nBut he (doc#1) did refer me to one of his practice partners who is a \"Bladder\" guy (vs. Doc#1 who acknowledges he is a kidney guy).  Doc #2 recommends re-TURBD plus MMC.  Both docs are board certified urological oncologists.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. I am comfortable with Doc#2's rec of re-doing the TURBT plus MMC because seems like lot to gain with little to lose.  Thoughts by others faced with same choice appreciated.\n\n2. I mostly read about MMC being the one-time chemo of choice with TURBT but also have seen in the cafe lots of discussion of Interferon and others.  MMC seems to be the standard/most commonly used.  Have not found articles or personal stories of comparisons or why choose MMC vs. something else.  Again, thoughts appreciated.\n\n3. I want to get an opinion outside this practice group.

Along with Carnegie Mellon Professor Don Marinelli, Randy was the co-founder of the Entertainment Technology Center, a leading interactive multimedia education and entertainment center.\n\nAt Carnegie Mellon, Randy was also the director of the Alice software project, a revolutionary way to teach computer programming. The interactive Alice program teaches computer programming by having kids make animated movies and games. A fitting legacy to Randy's life and work, Alice may in the future help to reverse the dramatic drop in the number of students majoring in computer science at colleges and universities. Randy was also known as a pioneer in the development of virtual reality, and he created the popular Building Virtual Worlds class.\n\nAn award-winning teacher and researcher, Randy was also a National Science Foundation Presidential Young Investigator and a Lilly Foundation Teaching Fellow. He used sabbatical leaves to work at Walt Disney Imagineering and Electronic Arts (EA), and he consulted with Google Inc. on user interface design. He is the author or co-author of five books and more than 70 articles.\n\nPerhaps the greatest lesson, however, Randy taught us all was how to live, even in the face of great challenges, and how to follow our passion. While Randy's greatest passion was clearly his family, he did not shy from sharing his passion for his work as a professor, for his students, and for Carnegie Mellon. We will miss Randy, but we will carry the memory of him and all that he did to make Carnegie Mellon a better university and each of us who knew him a better person.\n\nA memorial service for Randy will be scheduled at a later date.
