I can't look at fruit juice, broth or any other clear liquids without getting queasy.\n\nI woke up this AM feeling better than ever.  I had robotic assisted; the only large incision is less than 3 inches where they put my new bladder in--scars are cool.  Most of my pain comes from my lower back, a chronic muscle condition I had before the surgery.  I surprised myself this morning and sat up using my stomach muscles without thinking--so that site is doing better than I thought.  I saw my regular doctor about the back, so am taking something for that instead of the Percocet my surgeon prescribed, but I'm weaning off of that too.\n\nI'll see my surgeon tomorrow, so I can grill him about how much activity I can have.\n\nAs far as recovery, what was it like the first time you urinated \"normally\"?  I have my Foley out in a week and a half, the 4-week mark.  As I understand this, he will cap the super pubic tube, then have me drink a lot and see if I can urinate normally at his office.  If all goes well, a week later the SP comes out, and I'm on my own--kind of like taking the training wheels off.

In order of worst to best--back, GI, then surgery site.  Imagine that--the surgery was the easy part.  She ordered xrays and put me on Soma, a muscle relaxer and Tramadol for the pain.  I feel normal again.\n\nI don't get my foley out until the 4-week mark, another two weeks!  Then the fun starts.\n\nSo are you a doctor or simply someone with lots of experience?

Your doctor is best to answer that.  I guess as long as you're in reasonable health and have the insurance.\n\nWhat you are asking about is nerve/vascular sparing.  Don't be shy about offending your doctor by inquiring about who is the best, especially when it comes to the prostate.  Ask around, patients, nurses, etc.   Ask a lot of questions about this procedure, such as if they are using robotics--I heard a report that the DaVinci may not be as great as we're told, enough that there is an ambulance chaser commercial out.   I don't know about the success rate when it comes to sex after this surgery.  It would be interesting to hear.  Let's just say I've had issues.\n\nSomething else you might ask about.  There is a \"check valve\" between the bladder and your kidneys-ever wonder why it doesn't back up?  They take it out as part of the procedure.  This means you have to be careful to urinate regularly or the back pressure can damage the kidneys.  I'd ask if taking it out is necessary.

I am interested that you had chemo.  That was not an option for me, unless you're referring to the TB treatment.  Anyway, neos are a minor miracle, being able to walk around with a semblance of normalcy.  But no matter how rosey the doctor may make it sound, neo-bladder management is no cakewalk.  My doctor won't even do it for patients over 65.  Half of all neo patients have to cath themselves at least once, 5-10 percent have to everyday.  Some people can do this no problem--not me.  I'm determined to be part of the One-timer Club.\n\nDay time control is usually not a problem for most.  I\u2019ve heard of people even skydiving.  Success with nighttime incontinence varies, and can go on for several years.\n\nThat said, for my type of cancer (papillary, carcinoma insitu, and T1 High Grade), it was a no brainer--the TB treatment had a 40 percent recurrence after 5 years, 5-10 percent for the neo.  You've probably heard too many bad stories about conservative approaches to treating cancer, so opted for the neo.  It was a two-month recovery until I was able to go back to work fulltime, but others fair better.\n\nHave them check for prostate cancer now.  It comes out anyway with the bladder, but it's best to know everything going in.\n\nFinally, DEMAND the best surgeon, someone who's done the surgery for neos for many years.  With all the nerve and vascular cutting they have to do, you can end up impotent, and drugs may not help this.\t\t\t", "date": "2013-07-10T18:57:01+00:00", "topic": "Facing recurrence", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tThanks for the link.
