And I'm sorry.\nI've had no health issues myself (still chugging along as cancer free) but I have been focused on my friends who\nhave had cancer issues.\nStarting around Thanksgiving, my good friends Skip was diagnosed with esophageal cancer and had to have chemo and radiation to kill the tumor before they considered surgery. Luckily, he just had the surgery and is recovering and acclimatizing to his \"new normal.\"  There is an upside; you know me... There always has to be an upside..... He has to eat small meals all the time, every day, forever!  I gain weight eating a salad and he will lose weight eating 10,000 calories a day!   But he is a great guy and I am happy he will be around to eat in front of me and smile!\n\nThen at Christmas, my friend Brian, was found to have a tumor attached to his pancreas. The performed wipple surgery and pronounced him \"cf\". But then a week later, he had lymphnodes showing cancer and a ct scan showed tumors on his liver and very aggressive growth elsewhere.  He has undergone aggressive chemo and showed every single side effect possible. He also failed to have the last two treatments because of a low white blood cell count.\nToday we hope he can resume.\n\nThis may seem a depressing post, but it could have been a lot worse if Brian and Skip had been \"glass half empty\" people. Sure cancer is a BIG DEAL and SCARY AS HELL and Potentially deadly, but both my friends have been through MAJOR surgery and they have good \"TEAMS\" at home to help.\n\nThe only scary part for me is they want to be...... just like George!  They want to be just like they were before cancer.  I had to tell them of my \"new normal\"  They were surprised to find that my post surgery changes were as dramatic as they were.  So, as they start their new lives and complain about their challenges...... I use an old Saturday Night Live quote...... \"It is better to look good, than to feel good!\"\n\nI know this was posted in Newly Diagnosed and I did this for a purpose. Most of us old timers look here first because this is where we can do the most good by quickly showing that cancer is not a death sentence for many. But that attitude and teamwork will make the journey easier.  Life will change. You will not be \"perfect\" like before.\nBut if you make it through the journey, get up each day and be damn glad that you have that day. Even if you have to wash the sheets and wear a pad and see the Dr way too much.\n\nThank you all for being here.

And the only way to diagnose bc is through a cystoscope.\nYup, they put a camera up there and have a look around. They may even let you watch in living color.\nIf they see tumors, you will need to get to a bladder cancer specialist. BC is a tricky little devil and it has a habit of coming back. So.... you need a specialist.\nA Dr that has seen hundreds of cases. If you give your location here, I know someone can direct you to a bladder cancer hospital. This is important info.\n\nAfter the scope, and IF they see anything there, you will have a Trans uterial resection of the bladder (we call it a TURB). This is a rather minor operation and is usually done in hospital and you will be put under. The cancer will be cut out and analysed in pathology to determine what type it is.\nThere will be another TURB in a few weeks to determine if they got it all.\n\nSo, there you have it. The start of bc. treatment.\n\nFrom my experience;\nGet to a Bladder cancer specialist. People here can help.\nFollow the steps to recovery.\nDon't freak out! Try not to anyway. I know it's hard.\nIf they caught it early... and it sounds as though they did, You will get through this.\nWe are not Dr's but we have been there and we are still here. I was diagnosed seven years ago and I have had my bladder removed.... And I am still here.

But WELCOME!\n\nI know the feeling of frustration, and depression caused by bc(bladder cancer)\nThe first word of cancer sounds like a giant hammer on your physch. For a long time I would vow to get up every day and FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT! Only to find that a day later I was wallowing in the feeling that this was all a shell game as the cancer would win in the end. It was kind of a roller coaster.\n\nSo what do we do about the roller coaster of emotion that accompanies this long fight?  I guess the song says it best \"Roll With IT!\"\n\nDuring my cancer treatments (2TURBs and Bladder Removal) I worked a full time job as a new car dealer and; Sometimes it made me forget the cancer....... sometimes I fell into a \"What the hell am I doing?\" phase.\n\nTry as I might, I couldn't keep the self pity away forever.\n\nBut I did fiend a few things that worked for me. And you can use them too.\n\n1) I TALKED about it. With my wife(especially)kids, close friends. I even let my employees and customers know I had cancer and I was going to beat it.\n2) I formed a bond with my wife as a team member. She was my Rock. I told her EVERYTHING and we never held back. She also suffered along with me and we supported each other when times got tough.\n3) We(the team) took charge of our health care. We kept a notebook and had a powwow after each Dr. visit. Just to make sure we got the same info from the visit. there were times  when we challenged the Dr. if we felt he was treating us as a Number. She protected me and Prodded me thru the surgeries and the recovery.  I cannot tell you how important this step is.\n4) I was allowed to wallow in short bursts of self pity. Surprisingly it helped me cope. Then, my team would tell me to \"Get over it\" and pull my eyes up to all that I had to live for.  That became the reality check that got me going.\n5) I found this site. Filled with people who have been thru all kinds of stuff. They can help you find your way. They care about getting you the BEST treatment and keeping you focused on surviving. And we do survive dammit! Just last weekend I won 2 races at Watkins Glen in the SCCA weekend. We are survivors and never let this cancer thing beat us. And apparently we won't let anyone else beat us either.\n\nThanks for reading.

I was at home for almost 2 months and walking became the MOST important thing for me.\nYou will probably spend a week in the hospital after the surgery, and they will make you walk after the first day. You can see a trend here. You will be released from the hospital with a catheter and a kidney drain. They are a pain indeed and you will find a visiting nursing service is VERY helpful in getting this managed. I found that to be the hardest part, but we made it through. Infection is a big factor in your recovery. There are others here who have had endure longer hospital stays and returns to battle infection. So, follow orders and keep vigilent about cleanliness.\nYou will probably lose a few pounds.... I did... about 25. You will not eat much the first days at home but don't worry. As your intestines heal you will regain your appetite and it will come back.\nI guess the one thing that most men worry about is...... incontinence. You will be incontinent. Period. You will do keegles (your wife will tell you) and you will still leak. Just get on a schedule and  follow it. I had my lifesaving operation 3 years ago and I still leak at night. I laugh about it and wear a pad. If this is all I have to endure for being alive........ I'll take it!\n\nThis is a big step in saving your life.

I am most amused by the response of family and friends to cancer. Here are some of my experiences.\n\nOur parents are older, so my wife and I thought we would keep the emotion as low key as we could for them. We tried to minimize the serious nature of the whole ordeal. So we kind of snuck around to the Dr. visits and even hid the hospital visits for the TURBs from them. The RC was harder but we made sure to check in as usual by phone. My parents live in the same town and we kind of went on vacation.(my Mom has Alzheimers, so dad has a lot on his plate)\nThis plan worked to a T. I overheard my dad telling a friend who asked how things were. \"George had a small bout with cancer but it was so minor he just got through it!\"\nI guess our plan worked well.\n\nMy brother was so freaked out, he wouldn't come to see me until I had every tube and catheter removed. Even 3 years later, he will walk out of the room if someone casually asks about it.\nMy sisters came to visit in tandem only.. They needed each other I guess. Now these girls can talk a tin ear off a goose any day. But when they visited.. I had to put on the show or it would have been a silent movie. They have both decided I am a lunatic for returning to my former life as if nothing happened.\n\nI guess friends have their own response. As Mike said, they react in their own ways. Some react for themselves and their perceived loss. Some cannot approach a sick person because it brings their own mortality to bear. One of my best friends couldn't visit. I finally had to visit him! he couldn't take it!\nMy wife and I were blown away by the many cards and visits from friends we hardly knew we had. The seemed to come out of the woodwork. They pitched in for chores and shopping and just plain conversation.... Amazing.\n\nSo.......... You never know.. You just accept it!\n\nGood luck\n\nGeorge\t\t\t", "date": "2011-09-20T15:16:50+00:00", "topic": "everyone else", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tThis is NOT the end.

The girls were very confident that modern medicine was going to take care of this.\n\nWhen I told my older father and mother, it was another story completely. As I said the word cancer, my dad just kind of slumped in his chair. He was sure I was not going to survive cancer. So few did in his day. Cancer was a death sentence years ago. I ended up reassuring him that I was going to be OK. I also stopped giving him a Play by Play of my treatments. I was afraid that too much information would cause him to worry too much. My mother suffers from Alzheimers  and each 10 minutes is a new experience for her. I also didn't need to add the cancer burden to my dad's already stressful life as a caregiver.\n\nThe next group to be told was my dealership staff. I just flat out gathered everyone together and told them as a group. I asked that they work professionally and cover for me. My shortest term  employee has been with us for 7 years, so we are family. Everyone, and I mean Everyone, pitched in and put aside petty differences to keep the place humming as usual. After Surgery, my wife visited the Dealership and met with everyone again. She said the support was palpable. Even the tough mechanics were concerned.\n\nThe final group was friends and community members. I live in a small town and everyone knows everyone. I decided NOT to keep this a secret. I was afraid if the rumor mill got working, it would say \"He's got cancer, He's dead\"\nI spoke with everyone I came in contact with about it. I would quickly put their concerns at ease. I was so sure that I would beat this, I convinced them. Word got around that I was going to be fine. I soon became a \"go to guy\" when someone wanted to talk about cancer(friend, family, or themselves). The interesting thing was the people who came to me looking for a positive side to their cancer concerns. Some thought I had cancer \"lite\" because I kept telling them  I was going to be OK.  I did NOT show anyone my scar!\n\nOne year after my RC, I had a hip replacement. I kept the same attitude going.\n\nSome people think I had a ton of crap thrown on top of me, and life treated me unfairly. I tell them \"This IS Life\"  I am NOT a NASCAR fan, but I took a phrase from one of the teams..... I Refuse To Lose!\n\nOne last thing. I had some shirttail friends that came rushing to my side wanting to help or just \"be there\" I also had very good friends who suddenly \"couldn't handle it\" and stayed away.  There are many ways that people deal with cancer and cancer patients. They are still your friends either way.\n\nIt appears as though how \"the news\" is broadcast, has as many variants as the weather.

I wish I had found this site BEFORE I had my Neo bladder surgery.  My surgeon did a great job, but, I had ALL the same questions that you have!\nI found a Surgeon in Albany NY that had served at MD Anderson in Houston and knew his stuff.  My search for a surgeon was amusing to him. I asked him everything I was afraid of. Even told him that I was NOT a number. I had a lot of things to do with my life and if he was not up to the task, then I would look elsewhere. He was a little taken aback for a second. Then he opened up and we had a conversation. I think the medical community has a way of distancing themselves from the cancer patient. It may help them to cope.\n\nBut, after my \"I have a Dream\" speech, he really opened up and became a name.\n\nI have entertained my friends with my description of my surgeon.  I did NOT want an artist... I wanted an ASSEMBLY LINE WORKER.  I wanted a guy (or woman) that has done so many of these that he can do them in his sleep.  I kind of like the 1,000 count of successful surgeries as a guide.\n\nAs for the \"getting back in life\" part. I had my surgery on 08/08/08 and I was able to golf on Oct 15th, Ski on January 17th, and go auto racing on May 22nd. You will too. Reading your posts..... Maybe sooner!\n\nThe surgery is hard to recover from, but you will do it. Stay in good shape. This will speed your recovery. You will learn how to push yourself. Just knwo the difference between bad pain, and recovery pain or healing pain.\n\nOne thing you need to think about is The Ansthesiologist.... Very  important! They are instrumental in your recovery. These people can really make or break recovery time. You should have a consult before surgery. They ask a LOT of questions.... answer truthfully. I think my \"gas man\" made a big difference in my mental clarity after surgery.\n\nKeep up that positive attitude and you will be fine. The other people on this site KNOW their stuff and are more than willing to share.\n\nGood luck\nGeorge\t\t\t", "date": "2009-10-10T23:25:21+00:00", "topic": "Looking for some help!", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tI thought I would just talk about the embarrassment issue.

I went in and undressed, put on a gown, walked down the hall and greeted the nurse again. She said,\"remove your gown, lay down on this bed, andwe'll start. I said \"why did you make me go into that other room and disrobe?\" She laughed and said \" this is your first time here and we wanted to give you some dignity. There is no such thing as dignity in the urology dept.\" With that, she proceded to give me a topical novocain rub.(You know where) I told her that my wife would be concerned about this procedure.

Chew gum(but DON'T swallow it) and I suggest a pair of earplugs.(Hospitals are the Noisiest places on earth)\nWhen you get home, you will need your TEAM to help you. I don't know about Australia, but there has to be a medical source that can help you out as you get accustomed to the stoma.\n\nAnd last..... I now give you permission to be a little selfish. This is happening to you and you have the right to be selfish. Not too much, but you Can demand a little comfort. A little alone time to collect yourself. And... It is OK to get emotional.

I am assuming your surgeon did a \"nerve sparing surgery\" and, with time, you will get function to return.

I sincerely wish you the best and can now relate a little more to your situation. I strongly believe the positive attitude is THE key to recovery. The surgeon can only do so much. I feel that you are having such a hard time with this, partly because you have lost the will.\n\nJust so you don't think I come from the land of \"happy feelings,\" I can relate to how life can beat you down. We have both been through this cancer thing and it has taken its toll on us. I, too, have a mother who lives Very close by (300 yards) that is in the very late stages of Alzheimers and comes by 4 or 5 times a day with the darndest situations. My father is adament about NOT having any help in the house and relies on my wife and I to take over when we are not at work.\nSince 2008, I have seen the business world change and finally had to sell 40% of my business to keep it going. My health situation for the past 2 years has been a work in progress, to say the least.\nMy convertable sat in the garage for a full year before I Blew up the tires, put the top down, put on a coat and gloves, and roared off on a 300 mile blast through the lakes and mountains on a crisp 40 degree day. My spirit finally began to rise again.\n\nI too have been fortunate to have the Love of MY Life with me through this period.\n\nThis is where my strength and attitude finds it source. I have the BEST support group anywhere. And I think you do too!\n\nSo here we are. Life has been unfair.... very unfair. We can look into the sadness and follow it down. Or we can look at the life we have to live, the people who make it worth living, and pull ourselves out of bed every day. I look at each day as a CHANCE...  Just a Chance. To make a difference, to share a laugh, or a tear or a shoulder.  Great things have been accomplished by people who were given a losing hand in life. They never gave up. They looked outside of themselves and found purpose in living.  I was trying to do just that when I responded to your last post. I was trying to force your line of sight upward and forward. We cannot wallow in the things we have not. In every life there are challenges and problems. Some people are given an extra dose of hard luck, and they overcome and LIVE! And I do mean LIVE!\n\nI am hoping to PUSH you into LIVING. I am sorry I made your incontinence problem a source of humor. But, there is so much more to live for.

He stopped counting. You need and deserve a surgeon like this.\n\nTake it from me. If a used car (and new) salesman got the best, so can you! Don't let them treat you like a number either. Let them know who you are and let them know you have a LOT to live for! They want to do their best when they know you have a zest for life. I saw my surgeons notes, and he made mention of my \"Refuse To Lose Attitude\" I firmly believe he took that extra step because I demanded so much from him.\n\nPlease follow my Father in Laws rules of surgery ( he lives in a tiny town in Mich; Linden)\n1) Get a GREAT Positive ATTITUDE\n2) Get a great Surgeon\n3) Get a Great Anesthesialogist\n4) Get a Great Nursing and Post op Care\n5) Get Your family Involved.. Don't push them  away. They need you as much you need them! Don't push them away! Bring them in big time!\n\n6) Get to know this site and these people! They have been there and they do not Judge.

I did have the nerve sparing surgery and am just now, one year later, just getting the feeling back.\n\nMy advice is nothing new, but it makes sense.\n1) Make damn sure you have a POSITIVE attitude, it makes ALL the difference\n2) Make sure your surgeon is an assembly line worker who has done hundreds of these procedures. Also make sure you are very Positive about him or her. If you feel as though he is treating you as a number, stand up for yourself and let him know you are a valued human being, and have a lot to do in your life!\n3) Get to know your anestheisiologist. This person may be as important as your surgeon. Make sure they get all of your history and don't lie to them\n4) Keep your family in the loop. Remember they are suffering right along with you. They want to help, let them.\n5) Be a little selfish for yourself, but remember to be realistic. Your friends will want to be invilved too.\n\nYour surgeon will give you his opinion, You will ask question, talk it over.  Make it an informed decision.\nThe inconvenient things that happen will become a part of your daily routine.

I was tested and pronounced \"ready to go\" and I would not need any Chemo. I was elated, and my recovery went well. I dove headlong into recovery and headed to the gym as soon as possible. Maybe a little too soon.\nI was noticing some pain in my right hip. Now I had always had some pain there and this was just a little more. But, this soon became alarming in its intensity. I was soon walking like a very old man. I could barely walk 3 blocks. I looked exactly like grandpa on the \"Real McCoys\" (remember that show?)  I began to fear that this was a continuation of the Cancer. I made an appointment with my doctor and had to wait a week. My outlook started to be gloomy. I soon convinced myself that I was in trouble.\nTo make this long story shorter, I had an exam and X rays. The good news is; It does not appear to be Cancer related. The bad news is \"You are getting old and this is normal arthrites\"\nI just can't help but feel that from now on, every cough, ache, or upset stomach will trigger a feeling of doom. Or, am I just crazy?\nHow do you deal with this?

You must be someone very special and having gone through so much before this news, I think you may have some very strong abilities to face the challenges you are going to face.

It was only after I was home recovering that I stumbled on this site and  tenativly asked my first question \"Am I going to die from bladder cancer?\"\nMike responded that I was going to die from anything but bladder cancer.... as I no longer had a bladder to get cancer.

He and his wife were thunderstruck (you know the feeling) and felt as if they were on their own island.\nMy wife has always been my rock and we were more than willing to help.\nBut as they left and walked to their car, my rock was suddenly crying. She was thrown back to the time when we were unsure of survival. It never really gets too far away from the surface.\n\nI understand the fear of \"talking about it\" from both sides of the conversation. You don't want to be hanging it on your sleeve all the time (people will avoid you) but sometimes I find in conversation, that someone will be speaking of a hard time they are having and they need to hear from someone who survived.They need that light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nAs a comic aside; I have had absolutely HILARIOUS conversations about life after cancer (incontinence, adult diapers and the surprise you get when you lift something)\nSome people here have allowed these life changes to really get to them. I have found that making a joke of my journey and these changes, gives them a sense of humor.\n\nWe all have issues with this disease and its after effects. I remember mine.\nAfter going through the removal surgery, and then 12 days in the hospital with all the bags, ports, dressings, meds and all the big stuff............... I became absolutely crazed with the tiny needles they used to give me shots or take a blood sample. I was absolutely sure the surgery was easier than the needles.\n\nSometimes its the little things that get to you.\n\nBest of luck in finding you comfort zone\n\nGeorge\t\t\t", "date": "2016-12-15T00:55:11+00:00", "topic": "Looking for support group", "subforum": "17-chit-chat"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tWelcome to our support group!\nWhen I went thru the bladder removal surgery, I looked for a support group too.\nThere wasn't anything locally, so I started an internet search and fond this site.\nEven my Dr asked if I could help some of his patients with their concerns, as their was nowhere to go with their personal questions and fears.\n\nThis group is made up of survivors who have gone thru similar experiences as you have. They are more than willing to listen to your concerns and even your rages and rants. You are free to bare your soul and ask away!\n\nWe can't replace a face to face group but we are as close to it as you can get on the net.\n\nI do hope that your \"new normal\" is working out, without too many problems. And I hope you remain cancer free as you move on.\n\nI found out that years after cancer left me....... I still find myself remembering.\nI don't live with it on my sleeve, but I do not forget that this was a major point in my life and the little bastard can come back.\nBut as time passes, we get must get back on with our new life and push c into the back places of our minds.\n\nGeorge\t\t\t", "date": "2016-12-15T00:55:11+00:00", "topic": "Looking for support group", "subforum": "17-chit-chat"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tThese kinds of stories are not unusual ..... unfortunately.\nThere are all sorts of GP's pit there who are wonderful DR's and they lose sight of how\nserious these symptoms can be.

It seems pretty quick and easy to me (Yes I laugh about the size of the Brownie camera going in there)\nBut blood comes from somewhere and there is usually a reason for it.\n\nMy story is one of quick thinking on my GP's part.\nI was in for an annual physical for my licence. We usually yuck it up as we have for the past 39 years. The urine test came back with trace blood. The laughter stopped and the very next day I was in for an ultrasound...... And two days later I was at the urologist's office having a cystoscope and watching two tumors in my bladder.\n\nNever saw blood..... Never had a single symptom....

It's ridiculous!\" She said.\nSo, I left with her, and dropped her off to the dorm.(They actually had boys and girls dorm buildings!) And went back to watch the second showing!\n\nThe next day, after thinking about how much I blew it! I ran into my date and she asked about another movie date,...... Next weekend. I told her I would LOVE to take her to the Movies again...... But Not THIS movie! The NEXT Movie was Steve Mcqueen in LeMans (a Race Car Movie. No plot at all)\n\nSo, even with all of these stumbles.......... And a break for Separate Colleges........

But there is an upside. You could have made bourbon stuffing that was 90 proof when it got to the table (Yuck!)\nOr there was the charcoal bricket turkey I made the year I tried deep frying a turkey the first time! I pulled that baby out of the oil in front of 14 guests and my brother commented that we may not have enough peanut butter to feed the crowd!\nI am sorry you were sick for your Thanksgiving. But, with your good attitude (an a good soul wrenching cry) you saw the better side of the day.\nI propose we use this blog to tell of our funniest, worst, most painful Thanksgiving day disasters. Looking back on our most tragic Thanksgiving Day disasters, maybe we can find a little hope, laughter and meaning to a day that usually never comes out as planned.\nGeorge\t\t\t", "date": "2009-11-28T23:55:44+00:00", "topic": "Flu, the mashed potato war and Thanksgiving", "subforum": "17-chit-chat"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tHey, Men have 'em women don't.
