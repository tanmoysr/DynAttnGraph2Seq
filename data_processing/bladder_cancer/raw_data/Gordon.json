The link you provided had words to the effect and I quote, \"Overview of the SEER-Medicare data: Content, research applications, and generalizability to the United States elderly population\".  The key word being elderly.  If I read the abstract correctly, the data base pretains to the elderly population.  Not that this is not of importance in of itself, i.e. health care for the elderly (especially, since I am a member of that population of interest!!  ) but to generalize to the population as a whole is misleading.  There are bound to be some built in bias in treatment of this population, i.e. treatment of a 90 year old is different than that of a 65 year old.  I received a neobladder at age 65, not so sure I would have at age 90.  I will attempt to follow up on this observation with the authors of the study.

Are you waiting\nfor time to show you some better thoughts?\n\nWhen you turn around, starting here, lift this\nnew glimpse that you found: carry into evening\nall that you want from this day.

It was really a great experience.  I've \"cropped\" another photo taken\nthe same day and will frame it and place it in our cabin on Priest Lake in Idaho.  I never realized\nhow \"human\" he looks until I posted the photo.  No wonder \"big foot\" lure exists in our area of\nthe woods.   The cropped photo shows more of his front legs.\n\nAs I tell my friends, we have to enjoy those moments in between life's trial and tribulations.\nNature is my escape/passion.
