Shortages have become the norm after one maker left the market. The Toyko strain has been available out side the US for some time; it is working to pass FDA required testing. Toyko is in Phase 3 Testing which means:\n\n\" A phase III clinical trial tests a treatment that worked well for volunteers in a phase II clinical trial. Doctors use phase III to compare the new treatment with the standard treatment. They want to know if the new treatment is better, has fewer side effects, or both. So they put volunteers in different groups. The volunteers in each group get a different treatment.\n\nPhase III clinical trials can take many years. They may have several thousand volunteers. These must include men, women, and people of different ages and ethnic groups, if possible. This helps doctors learn how the treatment works in different people.\n\nIf a phase III clinical trial shows the treatment works well, doctors might begin using it with people outside the clinical trial. For example, if they learn that a certain amount of exercise lowers your cancer risk, they publish a report. This shares the information with other doctors. If the researchers or sponsor learn a new medicine is safe and effective, they can ask the government to approve it for people to use. In the United States, they ask the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA looks at the results of the clinical trial's phases.

The infusion center is staffed with people who's job is to get you through the course of chemo with minimal problems.\n\nYou should expect meet with a nurse educator prior to starting chemo, be given info about possible problems and how to handle them. You will likely be given a list of meds to have on hand to prevent/treat any problems. You should also have a 24/7 number to call (or an ER referral) for issues of great concern that arise unexpectedly.\n\nTwo items are REAL important. 1)  Report ALL problems and issues to the doctor/ nurse/ call line ASAP - DO NOT wait for a \"small problem\" to become a big problem. 2) you will have a plan (and meds) to deal with nausea and bowel movements - FOLLOW the plan, it is easier to stop problems than get back on track.\n\nEveryone involved wants you to get through chemo with minimal discomfort or problems - Let them do their job by reporting EVERYTHING and asking for help early.\n\nEating dry saltine crackers at all hours of the day and night really helped keep my stomach under control.

No recommendation is made here, only issues a that can be raised to obtain a workable treatment plan for your husband. These thoughts are based on my 5 year journey with bladder cancer - you will need the treating doctor's to understand your husbands full situation and determine how to best provide treatment for him.\n\nBCG is not the only option; it is generally accepted as the best initial treatment for non-invasive bladder cancer. When a patient cannot tolerate BCG, or during BCG shortages, other treatments are available. BCG does not work for all patients, and some patients find success with other treatments after BCG failure.\n\nThere is a video on this site, an interview with Drs Lamm and O'Donnell, both highly respected. In that interview they back off of some of the \"hazards\" associated with BCG. It is worth viewing for a further explanation of handling BCG. It is at:\n\nbladdercancersupport.org/bladder-cancer-forum/8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments/34287-bcg-and-septic-systems.html\n\nYou may need to involve an oncologist as well as the urologist and your husband's normal care team in finding a workable treatment plan. Make sure that all of the doctors will work together to plan treatment. Make sure that all of the doctors know ALL of the things that need to be considered - the disease, the proposed treatments, the ability of the patient to comply, and urinary habits you have described here. The group of doctors all need to be aware of all the issues.\n\nMitomycin MIGHT be an option to BCG. It is a chemotherapy drug not a biological, is routinely used for bladder  cancers. It can instilled then drained after an hour or so, all at a clinic. It MIGHT avoid the concerning urination issues you describe.

I have had a range of post TURBT side effects. Your experience is not unusual in my experience.\n\nBlood irritates and causes pain; internally they go together.\n\nExpect turbt scabs to release between 10 and 14 days. Sooner or later, and over a longer span. Stress or stretching the lower abdominal muscles can cause bleeding post turbt (my experience) - climbing stairs, lifting heavy items, jumping etc can cause or increase bleeding during the healing period.\n\nNot all biopsy sites heal at the same rate (says the doc) big sites take longer, more sites means a wider bleed time.\n\nMost important (per doc) is the amount of blood. light coloration is expected. Tomato soup needs to be looked at. Large amounts of blood clots or inability to urinate needs to be seen now. (per doc) Your Doctor may have a different opinion on what is 'normal'.\n\nWhen it bleeds, it hurts (for me)\n\nYour biopsy report may provide clues as to how many sites were sampled, the size and the depth of the samples taken.\n\nIf, like many of us, including me, blood in the urine was the sign that sent you to the doctor, THAT bleeding can continue until successful action is taken to address the cause of the bleeding -thus some bleeding may be caused by the underlying disease process - it may be with you for some time.\n\nAsk the doc about over the counter Pyridium or AZO bladder relief medication. It can help, as can staying hydrated and diluting the blood in the bladder. Pyridium turns urine orange and it stains clothing. Check with your doctor.\n\nYou will be seeing your urologist very frequently. If you are concerned about your care, or the ability to communicate, consider finding another urologist if you can.

Neither is a CT Scan.\n\nIf you are a veteran, you may be able to have blue-light done at a VA facility. If you are treating outside the VA, you may have a bunch of hoops to jump through to get just blue-light, and you may need to travel to a VA facility that has it.\n\nBlue light has failed, so far, to identify my CIS that is not seen under white light. It has also failed, along with white light, to show cis even when CIS has been found by random biopsies. The standard of care, as has been explained to me repeatedly, is the random biopsy. I'm not happy about that either. Fact is, CIS can be hard to identify, particularly of is starts to burrow in or for nests. Various institutions are currently conducting Blue light studies - I have been in a study for over a year - the goal is to determinw WHEN blue light will be effective.\n\nLife would be sweet if the popular press' articles on 'cancer advances' stuck to the facts instead of touting the advance as the next sliced bread.\n\nCT rarely shows CIS except sometimes as a 'wall thickening', which is not diagnostic by itself. CT is rather insensitive to small growths in the bladder, and many but not all are missed. The best CTs I have had are with up-to-date software, a 3 Tesla magnet, and very small \"slice\" distance.\n\nThere is a reason for all the tests - CT shows more than the bladder - cytology, is a screening test that is best at suggesting high grade, but with false positives and negatives.\n\nThe \"Gold Standard\" and I hate that term, remains the cystoscopy and TURBT. At least for me.\n\nI understand the desire for blue magic, I had to battle for it, but I gained nothing, sadly. Hopefully others can offer positive results from Bluelight.\n\nBest\nJack\t\t\t", "date": "2019-02-10T01:20:33+00:00", "topic": "Blue light cystoscopy", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tJjbrown,\n\nAs each of us starts our personal journey toward cancer - any type of cancer - we seem to share a constellation of experiences.\n\nWhen first told we need additional test because we might have cancer, our minds go completely blank (or race too fast) preventing us from asking any questions.\n\nThen, in a full panic mode we hit the internet, where we get scared by lists of symptoms and warning signs that demand our attention - some from posts by people who have a book or a magical cure they want to sell.\n\nThe first part of reality hits when we find that medical tests will be scheduled a month out, and that reports can take a week or two. Our doctor schedules a return visit in a month, and suddenly we panic again. \"I have cancer, and suddenly the world is in slow-mo. Don't these doctors care about ME ?\"\n\nWe convince ourselves that every ache and pain is a sign of the end, the cancer has spread and no one did anything to help. We are suffering from lack of information, and lack of an action plan. We do what people do best - we panic again.\n\nEventually, we complete an initial set of tests including things such as a CT Scan, a cyctoscopic exam, and a resection (fancy word for biopsy) of a suspicious  growth(s). Then we get to wait on pins and needles for the pathology report to be delivered.\n\nFINALLY, we have some REAL information that can lead to a diagnosis (maybe it is NOT cancer after all) and a treatment plan is developed. We are gung-ho to start, but there are more delays. The delays will never end, sorry to say.\n\nAt some point we come to realize that nothing happens fast - unless medical tests indicate a true emergency - then we want things to slow back down.

Much of this is what a Physiatrist MD specializes in - this doctor is usually like a non-surgical orthopeadist.\n\nWhat is a Physiatrist? Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R) physicians, also known as physiatrists, treat a wide variety of medical conditions affecting the brain, spinal cord, nerves, bones, joints, ligaments, muscles, and tendons.(efinition from Dr. Google)\n\nAlso, I left off asking if you had tried a pain disruption unit - often called a TENS unit and by other names. Through EKG type pads placed on the skin, the little battery powered control box peovides a pulsed electrical current - a tickle - that is intended to interrupt the pain signal that is passing through the nerves. There are LOTS of different TENS units, and levels of programming. May or may not help, but a proven aid for many. I get mixed results. Unfortunately, everybody responds differently.\n\nBottom line - I hope I have given you some hope for PAIN control out side of the cancer treatment rhelp, but within the proven medical community.\n\nASK you cancer doc for a referral to a social worker or nurse navigator to find appropriate resources to get your dad out of pain and back to the better side of life.

Real doctors, not necessarily the cancer doctor although s/he will be involved, can deal with specific pain issues. I have unrelenting pain in one leg that is controlled, not cured, by my pain management specialist, a part of the practice of anesthesiology. Every 6 weeks to 6 months, when the burning pain returns, my doctor kills a part of the sensory nerve that is transmitting the pain signal - after a couple of weeks, there is pain relief, and the muscle control nerves are intact, the leg still works. Starting the process can take longer or be instant, nor every session get the full result, BUT I KNOW THAT THERE IS RELIEF AVAILABLE.\n\nI too have many friends that want help and make recommendations. Some suggest juicing, swimming, prayer, soaking is special salts, cleansing programs, and of course cannabis. THC, the psychoactive part of cannabis has never been recommended, but, at least here, CBDs - the supposed body repair part of the plant, in oil form is recommended to be rubbed on, not ingested. the conflicting cannabis claims are proof of the lack of proof.\n\nPlease talk to dad's doctors about 1) obtaining pain control and 2) about how to get dad back to whatever he is missing because of the pain. It may not be easy or fast. It wasn't for me, but hope can REALLY help. Talk to the cancer doc, pain medicine doctors, rehabilitation physicians the local cancer society and any other honest and legitimate health providers in your area. If you can, consult with one of the nationally recognized cancer centers offering multi-discipline cancer care.\n\nI assume you have tried over the counter topical pain medications containing ingredients such as Lidocaine, menthol and eucalyptus are common. The prescription Flector patch helped me some. If the cost is low, and there is some real chance of help, it is likely worth a try, bur repeated failure is to be avoided if possible.\n\nChronic pain wears a person down. It can take the joy of daily life away. Hope helps a lot, any amount of success brings real joy and a thirst for more. Real doctors with real compassion  have been a real help to me. Some of the other ones just want to help, some just want your money.\n\nThank you for looking for ways to help your dad. I hope you find one or more that work for him.

There are a number of options, again depending on specifics. The gold standard is to remove the bladder (RC) before the CIS goes invasive, an option that is presented to me at every 3 month checkup and treatment series. BCG was not the magic bullet for me, so I have moved on to those other options. You will have options too.\n\nYou and your husband both have a cancer, just as my wife and I do. It takes a team, working together, to get through this. Both of you are affected by the cancer.\n\nYou mention the doctor saying \"2 to 4 years\". I HOPE s/he explained that was a \"possible\" time for CIS to progress, not a statement of life expectancy.. Consider the following about CIS  -\n\"The mean interval from the time of diagnosis to cancer progression was 5 years\", and\n\"Actuarial progression free, cancer specific, and all-cause survival rates were 63%, 79%, and 55%, respectively, at 10 years\".

Has anyone experienced this? id this due to the cancer? \"\n\nWhile I do not relate headaches to the side effects of bladder cancer, the rest of your description has an all too familiar ring. Others have noted similar trouble.\n\nImmediately PRIOR to the first appointment with a urologist, side effects of what became to be known as bladder cancer hit hard. Frequent need to urinate, inability to urinate, blood in urine, and extreme bladder spasms. The spasms caused pain in the abdomen and both legs. Getting comfortable or sleeping was nearly impossible, except when the spasms would lessen for a while. Up and walking, constantly changing position, up all night until so tired that sleep was all but impossible while waiting 4 days for an appointment.\n\nThe best explanation given was that the bladder spasms were putting pressure on adjacent nerves. Very uncomfortable - in retrospect, I should have gone to the ER instead of waiting.\n\nLying on the back and placing a hot pack (warm) over the bladder helped, and followed by massaging the area over the bladder also helped with later bladder spasms producing the same leg and abdomen pains during treatment. Relaxing the bladder spasms was my key to lessening the side effect. WORTH A TRY.\n\nALWAYS talk to dad's care team with any and every problem, issue, concern or fear.

There appear to be actions that you might be able take immediately, with the help of your current doctor. Schedule that CT scan ASAP so that it will be ready soonest, ask about starting pre-surgery chemo immediately, while waiting for a consult. Use the time waiting for a second opinion to your advantage. Ask for a second reading of the biopsy material by an outside lab.

So many fine points about BC.\n\nA clear explanation of why a TURBT may be advisable when only CIS is present is on page 1 & 2 of an article authored by Michael O'Donnell, a source I trust. Obviously, there is a range of CIS involvement, from minimal to extensive coverage of the bladder; physician judgment will determine the need to biopsy CIS.\n\nO'Donnell cites the Prognostic Factor of CIS. My Urologist explains it thusly, \"When I see lots of CIS on the surface, I have to wonder what is below\".\n\nCIS is always considered aggressive or high grade, and must be treated. It can't be both of those things and also be described as \"only a superficial surface rash\". O'Donnell explains:\n\n\"Tis \u2014 Tis (also called carcinoma in situ [CIS]) is characterized by severe cellular dysplasia in the absence of discrete tumor formation. Areas of mucosal involvement with Tis are often found in association with invasive disease. The presence of Tis in the mucosa adjacent to a Ta or T1 tumor appears to increase the risk for muscle invasive disease [5-8]. The potential prognostic significance associated with Tis is illustrated by a multicenter series 243 Treatment of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients who underwent radical cystectomy for carcinoma in situ without more invasive disease [7].\n\n\"Staging based upon the cystectomy specimen revealed that Tis, T0, or Ta in 48, 8, and 8 percent of cases, respectively. However, T1, T2, T3, and T4 disease was detected in 13, 12, 5, and 6 percent of cases, respectively. Lymphovascular invasion and positive lymph nodes were found in 9 and 6 percent, respectively.\n\n\"The presence of Tis without invasive urothelial cancer is associated with a high incidence of progression to invasive disease, even after transurethral resection and treatment in intravesical BCG. In a retrospective, single institution series of 155 patients managed with transurethral resection and intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), the five-year cumulative incidence of progression to cT1 or higher disease was 45 percent (95% CI 37-55) [8].\"\n\nFull article at:\nether.stanford.edu/urology/Treatment%20of%20non-muscle-invasive%20bladder%20cancer.pdf\n\nBest\nJack\t\t\t", "date": "2017-02-13T22:37:25+00:00", "topic": "Post BCG Check", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tDJB,\n\nWhile only your doctor is in a position to determine a cause and offer solutions, What you describe is not unusual.\nALWAYS check with your doctor before listening to me or anyone else.\nWe can commiserate, because your husbands story is known to many - we hurt and answers are way to slow in coming.\n\nInitial symptoms that sent me - and countless others - to the urologist included:\nInability to urinate despite a feeling of great urgency,\nVoiding tiny amounts 10 to 50 ml at a time.\nFeeling a need for a bathroom every 5 or 10 minutes\nBurning with and without voiding,\nBladder pain and spasms.\nPink to bright red blood and clots.\n\nWhile being treated by the doctor, these same symptoms reappear for a while, as the bladder had been intentionally irritated with BCG - the amount of irritation does seem to vary from individual to individual.

I find that both bladder pain and penile pain can be caused  by activities that exert, even mildly, the abdominal muscles. Simple tasks can be the source of pain that can last for days.\n\nMY thought on a couple your specific comments.\nThree days of bleeding seem a long time to go without a doctor cauterizing the bleeding spots following a TURBT. As for blood and clots two weeks later, as the scabs come off of healing biopsy sites, around two weeks later SOME SMALL amount blood and clots are not unusual. (Based on MY experience - with heavy bleeding and cautery following  TURBTS and post TURBT scabs.\n\nMy experience with BCG and bladder volume is that bladder volume has decreased. Four months after BCG my bladder capacity returns to about 60 % of what it was prior. My doctor blames chronic inflammation and BCG induced cystitis.\n\nThere are medications to relieve urinary pain - in the US called AZO  (phenazopyridine), which acts only in the urinary tract. Ask his doctor what drug is available there and how to use it. There are also medications to help with bladder inflammation; ask the doc.\n\nI am not sure how you get medical people to answer questions in OZ. Perhaps you just have to get tough. It always helps to have another person with the patient - someone less involved (and rowdy?) who can DEMAND answers and will not settle for rubbish. One of my favorite approaches is to ask, politely, \"If you can't help with this, who can you refer me to who CAN help ?\n\nBelow are links to two articles from the medical press. The first describes the extremes of bladder capacity loss. The second is positive for those of us who experience wildly unpleasant side effects from BCG - it posits that heavy inflammation is a good sign.\n\nBladder Contracture following BCG\n\ndeepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/31077/0000754.pdf;jsessionid=4C24B769B931E93844BAC7F95F9F65D4?sequence=1\n\nPrognostic value of inflammation after BCG\n\nwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24717097\n\nAgain, this is not medical advice, it comes from my personal experience going through BC. I hope it helps you focus on presenting YOUR issues to the doctor in well defined terms, and helps you receive specific answers in return.\n\nBest\nJack\t\t\t", "date": "2016-11-10T04:15:57+00:00", "topic": "Bad Biopsy or just the BCG?", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tMark,\n\nThat is a good looking path report, all things considered, given an expected cancer diagnosis.\n\nNow the doc can suggest a treatment plan.

It seemed like no one cared that this was REALLY IMPORTANT. It turns out that it is OK - they do care, but unless someone drops the ball, the process chugs along at a (what now seems like an almost) proper speed.\n\nLet me slow you down a bit. That is the advice none of us want to hear. We want full steam ahead to get the cancer out. But step one is the initial diagnosis, which may suggest additional tests or a repeat TURBT. The diagnosis IS happening, a treatment plan will follow; wait for them.\n\nRemember, caught early, superficial bladder cancer is highly treatable. It is not treated instantly, it is a process that takes time. Use the time prior to the diagnosis to learn about your insurance plan - what is covered, if coverage is different for \"in plan\" and out of plan providers. Who do you call for information.\n\nYour insurance card should have a number or website to call for information. Get the list of plan providers and coverage.\n\nYou can look ahead to the local NCI centers, and find their requirements and options for second opinions online or on the telephone. Again, requirements always seem to differ.\n\nUCSF\ncancer.ucsf.edu/\n\nStanford\nstanfordhealthcare.org/medical-clinics/cancer-center.html\n\nI hope this helps.

Until you have the biopsy report, you don't yet have a first opinion.\n\nOnce the pathology is in, your doc can explain what was found, and explain what treatment s/he proposes. Not all 'red patches' are CIS - they can be cystitis or irritation of the tissues The symptoms of bladder cancer seem to be the generic, without being specific to papillary or CIS cancer.\n\nThe easiest second opinion is simply asking that the biopsy material be reviewed by a major cancer center pathology lab.  Check with your insurance about coverage.\nYou may want to ask the doc what range of services s/he can offer, and ask where s/he refers patients that need other services. It sounds like you are looking ahead and trying to identify possible options, should advanced capabilities become necessary. Seeking a second opinion does not necessarily mean you intend to leave a treating doctor in whom you have confidence.\n\nYou can ask for a referral for a second opinion at any time.  You don't need a reason other than it would make you more comfortable. The process is easier with cooperation from your current treating doctor.\n\nSome doctors seem relieved to send cancer cases off to more specialized practices. The local doc may see a lot of prostates and UTIs but not much bladder cancer.\n\nOf course, it is also appropriate to simply say, 'I am anxious and concerned, please refer me for a second opinion'.

We need to know the next 4 steps ahead and plan for all contingencies.

A couple of weeks or so late, there MAY be a day or so lost as the scabs come off and there is additional bleeding. No one can predict how YOU will be impacted.\n\nIf your work involves heavy labor, you will may lose more time than if you have a desk job. Again, it is all variable until you see how it goes.\n\nYou might want to tell the boss that you MAY expect to need a few days off, planned and/or unplanned, here an there until you have a better idea of what lies ahead. You should be available via phone or computer during most of those times.\n\nUntil you get the pathology report back - up to a week - you really can't form a plan. The good news is that BC caught early is highly responsive to treatment, and that it does not have to have an impact on work. You will know a lot more shortly.\n\nBottom line, I gave you a long answer to a question that has too many individual variables to answer properly. Try to take it one step at a time.

This site preserved my sanity after I was Dx with bladder cancer.\n\nPrior to the BC Dx I went through a bleeding problem - perhaps I can offer a place to start looking for help with your dilemma.\n\nHeparin IS a blood thinner. Different people react in different ways. Google \" Heparin Kidney Bleed\" and such terms - see what you find that relates to YOU.\n\nI bled on blood thinners Lovenox  and Rivaroxaban. Pool of blood around the kidney and into the retroperitoneal space. GFR (and creatinine) crashed. ER doc said either we CT the kidney with contrast or we remove it. Drug called \"N Acetyl Cysteine\" was given help protect the kidney, low qty of contrast was used. Few days in the hospital, and I left with 2 kidneys.\n\nThe important part is that I was sent to a Hematologist for a full blood workup. Looked at minor blood fractions, to try to decide what blood thinner I could use, and which blood thinners  were incompatible with ME. The Hemo wound up suggesting Coumadin (Warfarin) for ME. BOTTOM LINE: worth a workup  to see *IF* the Heparin is, as you suggest, a possible problem. Of course, when we need blood thinners, we need blood thinners, The Hematologist IS the blood expert.\n\nUreters are looked at with contrast, either from the top (IV) or the bottom (squirted up from the bladder during cyctoscopy).\n\nSo, looks like you need a kidney doc and a blood doc - or better yet, a team that can address all the issues that are limiting imaging. Use Google, enter terms that sound like your situation; hopefully, you find a report that sounds like your issues are addressed.\n\nI hope this helps and is not old news.

Reducing the dose offers little relief for me, others find great relief.\n\nI have been chasing CIS for 3 years and 3 months (who's counting). BCG knocks it down, I get a clean scope or TURBT or two, then it's back. I'm up to 24 BCG plus maintenance, with various add-ins and intravesical chemo. The CIS has not progressed but just doesn't seem to want to leave.\n\nI'm not a good candidate for a RC due to prior injuries, so the battle with the CIS continues.By all opinions, BCG is the #1 choice for CIS. Various authors have expressed  the opinion that it may take more than one round of induction of BCG, and that maintenance is critical for resistant CIS. You may well be on your way to good outcome.\n\nMy heavy reaction to BCG started with the 4th dose and just get stronger as time goes on. Heavy drugs make the BCG treatments possible for me. I have a spinal cord injury, I'm missing a kidney and have lots of miles on this body. The spasms set me off. I lose 3 to 5 days, and just qualify for the following week's dose, but only if the bleeding has stopped. All this to say, Yes, BCG can be a real problem for some of us, but I'll keep doing it until something works. The gain will be worth the pain.\n\nDon't be a hero with the BCG pain and problems. Write them down and talk to your care team about EVERYTHING. Spill your guts. They can't help you if they don't know what symptoms are happening.\n\nTry to figure out what helps with BCG. I find that peeing while standing is better than sitting. Walking through the heavy spasms is better than lying in bed. A hot towel over the bladder helps. AZO or pyridium does help a bit. Warm liquids help more than cold ones. Use all the hot water for showers. Sleep whenever things lighten up for a few minutes.\n\nThink positive. You are on the recognized treatment. You have a great chance of beating the CIS with BCG. The course is 6 weeks long, and gets shorter with each dose - you know there is an endpoint for the round of 6 treatments. Get your care team on board to help you get through it as easily as possible. There are lots of other options to look to later if needed.\n\nWe can beat this cancer.\n\nBest,\nJack\t\t\t", "date": "2018-11-16T23:30:03+00:00", "topic": "New side effects with 2nd round of BCG Treatments", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tWOW !

The article is getting old, circa 1999.\n\nAs O'Donnell says, we have the SWOG/Lamm schedule because it has shown to be better than other schedules that have been tried.\n\nDr. Lamm has agreed with that, and in his blog he notes (not quoting) \"there has been such success with the SWOG schedule that it would take a huge number of patients on another schedule to provide evidence of a better treatment plan. Dr Lamm also agrees with hold off treatments when necessary, giving time for the bladder to recover from a prior treatment. Over all, Lamm gives the impression that staying as close as reasonable to the SWOG schedule is important, but some variation .is acceptable.\n\nI have had that discussion with a number of doctors. I have yet to meet one who is absolutely rigid on time between BCG treatments.\n\nI would like a nice simple, one treatment plan is the best for all cases of bladder cancer.

There IS a wide variation in treatment plan between doctors, and none I have asked have been able to give me a good reason for not following SWOG.\n\nOn the other side, many in this forum have reported short courses of BCD,  without follow up treatment, and are doing well.\n\nSo , Is it OK to delay a BCG treatment ?

I suspect that you have had a MRI or CT to look for any extension of the bladder cancer.\n\nGrade and stage will define how agressive and how advanced your cancer is currently, and help forulate a plan treatment.\n\nAs Sara Anne mentioned, started early, BCG is an entry treatment for bladder cancer - there are a number of more agressive treatments. When started early, BCG has an outstanding track record of controlling or resolving bladder cancer. Unfortunately, sometimes it is necessary to move on to other treatments.\n\nIt is always good to focus on general health - diet, exercise, lifestyle when dealing with cancer. Personal choice changes, such as you mention, while lacking any level of documented effectiveness, can be continued with your doctor's agreement. Eliminating sugar and flour is a personal choice. Curcumin has been recommended by some, without any convincing evidence, but see what your doc says about it. CBD oil has been pushed by those who profit from the sale, as a cure for a huge range of ailments; ask your doctor about CBDs, and try to find good research that supports CBD use in bladder cancer - I find no such evidence in my 2 1/2 years of research.\n\nBCG is clearly the way to start, when it is recommended.  Even as good the liklihood or success, it is not 100% - I have moved on to chemo, as have others.\n\nBottom line - only the conventional treatments offer real hope of BC cure or control. Add anything you like, with your doctor's approval, and give yourself the best chance of beating your  BC.\n\nBest,\nJack\t\t\t", "date": "2018-01-12T18:08:25+00:00", "topic": "First Cystoscopy after first TURPT.

Stage is subject to change over time. Grade is a stable description of the propensity of a cancer to spread aggressively. Grade is assigned by the pathologist who examines the biopsy material. The terms High and Low Grade can be further resolved into grades 1 to 4.\n\nSo, TaG4 indicates noninvasive papillary carcinoma with a higher likelihood to grow and spread than a lower grade.

Remove early, and the cancer is gone. Wait a little too long and there is a chance of undetected invasion and spread.\n\nI am at or close to the decision point - I can continue BCG or go for the RC. There is no easy answer. Other issues may help make or influence a decision - are there other health factors to consider ? Age ? Lifestyle ? Support ? Quality of life issues ?\n\nThe \"WHEN\" is going to come down to what will let you sleep at night.\n\nI made an early decision to go with BCG and I question that choice daily - but I can still sleep at night.\n\nTalk to the Doc, get a second opinion. Ask if a round of BCG would increase the risk. Only you and the doctors can determine when you are pushing the risk of invasion too far.\n\nBest to you both,\nJack\t\t\t", "date": "2017-02-09T17:37:09+00:00", "topic": "BCG for high grade invasive tumour", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tMistersac,\n\nI uploaded a recent file that compares BCG treatment protocols and results over the long  and short term.

After a short abstract, the Journal editors added a BOLD FACE, LARGE TYPE editorial comment, as follows:\n\n\"Editorial Comment\nAllyl isothiocyanate is particularly abundant in mustard, horseradish and wasabi, and it is mainly responsible for the pungent flavor of these vegetables. Allyl isothiocyanate is synthesized and stored as sinigrin (a glucosinolate) and is subsequently generated from the latter through myrosinase catalyzed hydrolysis of sinigrin. Myrosinase coexists with sinigrin in vegetables but glucosinolate hydrolysis does not normally occur until the vegetable is damaged, such as by insect chewing, fungal invasion, chopping and human mastication. Myrosinase activity also exists in the intestinal microflora in animals and humans, and glucosinolates that escape the action of vegetable myrosinase may be hydrolyzed in vivo. The authors show that allyl isothiocyanate rich mustard seed powder possesses potent anticancer activity in cultured bladder cancer cells and an orthotopic rat bladder cancer model in vivo, and that the mustard seed powder matrix has no effect on absorption and urinary excretion of allyl isothiocyanate. However, allyl isothiocyanate yield in vivo is extremely low in animals given purified sinigrin, indicating poor conversion from sinigrin to allyl isothiocyanate by the myrosinase like enzyme in the intestinal microflora. If not hydrolyzed by myrosinase, sinigrin has no anticancer activity.\nThe anticancer effect of MSP-1 was accompanied by modulation of multiple well-known cancer therapeutic targets, including activation of caspase-3, cleavage of polyadenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase, and down-regulation of cyclin B1 and vascular endothelial growth factor. Comparison of dose response in vivo between inhibition of tumor growth and muscle invasion by MSP-1 and its modulation of the aforementioned proteins suggests that down-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor may be critical for MSP-1 to inhibit tumor invasion into the muscle. Taken together, MSP-1 is a highly promising substance for prevention and treatment of bladder cancer. Further preclinical and clinical evaluation of this substance is warranted.\"\n--end citation\n\nUnfortunately, not everything posted to the net has been vetted.

I predict that you will get past that challenge, but that it will take a bunch of effort on your part.\n\nIt has been 17 years since my accident. They told my wife that I would lose both legs and one arm. When I came to three weeks later, I learned that she would not allow amputation. Great to have her by my side.\n\nAfter a month in a coma, you are as weak as a kitten. All the hard work you did before surgery puts you in a good position to regain strength, but the strength is not there for you now.  You likely have started exercises of pushing a pillow with your feet, and lifting your legs as you lie in bed. Learning to walk again truly starts from square one, except they don't let you crawl around on the carpet and drool.\n\nFirst time I was transferred to a toilet from bed (bedpans deserve their own message) I was absolutely shocked to find out that I could not stand up from seated. There was nothing there. Moved back to sitting on the edge of the bed, I could not get my feet and legs in bed without help. Sucks. (Does any of this sound familiar ?)\n\nMake sure that your physical terrorist (therapist) works you hard. Do all the exercises, no matter how silly they seem - every bit of strength added, every muscle awakened, gets you closer to walking again. Do not ignore \"gait training\" - it is all too easy to find a way of moving and stick with it, but there may be better ways to move that will require someone to make you do it. Learn to check out ALL the mobility muscles - as soon as you notice one that is not responding, get help before you fall in to a poor walking problem. Unused muscles become a real problem later. You can do this.\n\n17 years and I still use a cane on the good days, but at least dogs and cats know I mean business when I encourage them to not run under my feet. There is a walker in the closet for the really bad days. Everybody adjusts, and learns to not notice, no matter how many times a cane falls over at the dinner table. Stay Vertical.\n\nI know it is tough dealing with loss of strength, learning to eat, deal with the diversion and whatever else will pop up all at once. But that's the way it is. Push yourself, but don't be hard on yourself. A new normal can be a rough thing to adjust to, but it is a heck of a lot better than no normal at all.\n\nBest to you and yours, as you all work together and get through this. You can do it.

There are options; you want to know about ALL of your options.\n\nBladder cancer surgery, being major, usually warrants a second opinion.\n\nImportant questions may include the following, depending on your situation:\n\nWill your local Urologist be providing full treatment of follow-up services ?\nWill you be referred to a bladder cancer specialist for consultation or surgery ?\nHas the biopsy material been submitted for a second opinion ?\nDoes the biopsy material provide a clear margin surrounding the cancer ? Is there any evidence of invasion beyond muscle tissue ?   How deep into muscle tissue ?\n\nAt each level of consultation, ask about options for treatment and how a particular course of treatment may impact YOUR daily life.\n\nWhen a recommendation has been offered, ask, \"Who is best qualified for this?\"\n\nThe care team needs to know about you. Spill your guts about your concerns, desires and fears about the cancer journey. The care team needs to be focused on YOUR issues, and to do so they need to hear from you throughout the process.\n\nIt is easy to \"get lost\" in the maze of modern medicine. Ask, and always know, \"Who can I call, in a position of authority, 24/7, during treatment when a problem arises.\"\n\nHoping this helps you prepare for a treatment discussion,\n\nBest\nJack\t\t\t", "date": "2017-04-14T23:57:00+00:00", "topic": "Stage 2 diagnosed from TURBT; What should I ask my urologist next week?", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tLotech,\n\nHang in there bud - hormonal changes during things like chemo and/or any hospitalization happen.

I hope I can say this right - I want this to be positive, but impersonal computers make it hard.\n\nI have been where you are now. I'm sure others here have also. Sometimes life sucks big time and the journey is overwhelming.\n\nEventually it is time to consider what you will do tomorrow. Take it one day at a time. Hug the kids, talk with a friend, do lunch, whatever may be your thing. This becomes habit forming; when you are ready plan a bit further ahead.\n\nHere it gets tricky. You want to travel, but are concerned about appointments every 3 weeks. GOOD, you  are looking 3 weeks ahead already. MAKE your doctor schedule a treatment for wherever you will be in 3 weeks (Oakland?). Contact your insurance company - get them to authorize treatment wherever you will be located. Plan in advance to make your trip happen. It can be done - out of local area treatment is needed all the time. If necessary, ask your doc what would happen if you walked into an ER in a state far away from home and said, \"I need a treatment ?\".\n\nIf that is not working, how about you start driving a day or so after a treatment, and flying home in time for the next treatment ? (Think about travel needs)\n\nThis is for you, not about me, but I know it can be done. When your life gets turned inside-out you have to work harder to do the things you want to do.

The option for RC still exists for me (us) - However none of us are metastatic.\n\nIt is real hard to compare treatment options by looking at a small group.

I find it positive that your current uro was able to do a cystoscope on a first visit - I see that as a sign of a well prepared and staffed office.\n\nAll of us are taken by surprise when we hear the word CANCER or Possible Cancer. The mind can go blank and fear can set in. Thank goodness my 2nd uro did an immediate scope and said \"Looks like Cancer\". The sooner diagnosed - by turbt and a pathology report - the sooner treatment can start, or you will find out is not cancer. I hope you get a clean path report.\n\nI an unfamiliar with chemo pills.

I depend on depends for a week or so after a turbt. Some report no troubles at all.\n\nYour second uro sounds like a doctor I would appreciate.

How long can we try to control bladder cancer before turning to a radical cystectomy  in hopes of removing all of the cancer ?\n\nBottom line seems to be there is no real answer. There are some suggestions from the experts in the field. In the earlier consensus study, Dr. Lamm suggested  that there is a window of about 2 years from initial diagnosis to try other treatments, when BCG failed to do the job. Then it is time to seriously consider an RC, to prevent progression from superficial to invasive and metastatic bladder cancer.\n\nOther considerations can be important. Some individuals are not good candidates for the RC surgery. It also matters the type of BC - high grade, low grade, papillary or CIS.\n\nBeing both a poor candidate for an RC and having CIS, I can look to an earlier article from Lamm where he discusses the options, and timing of the decision for a select group. Unfortunately, he winds up describing two possible outcomes, and fails to find a way to sort people by outcome. The article, however, offers insight to making  the RC decisions with less that full knowledge for this particular group of individuals.\n\nA summary and link to the full article are found at:\nwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8573479\nThere are some surprises in the article.\n\nIf we look at a large number of reputable Consensus Documents, there is general agreement that delay in moving to an RC can be a BIG mistake when early treatments fail.\n\nOn the positive side, there are increasingly good reports on the newer drugs, such as Keytruda, in treating bladder cancer, when all else fails.\n\nEach of us, individually, want the best outcome for ourselves. There is no strong consideration for, nor  guidance about,  all of our unique situations other than our treating care teams.\n\nBest\nJack\t\t\t", "date": "2019-07-05T17:03:31+00:00", "topic": "T1-G3 New treatment Gemzar Questions", "subforum": "6-men-and-bladder-cancer"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tSWArmy,\n\nI understand the desire to be treated as an individual and medicine's tendency to treat unins the \"local standard of care procedures\".

Just some of us have other issues we think need to be considered, and we have to accept responsibility if id a Doc agrees and trys something other than an RC.\n\nI'm surprised that the VA has been an issue. VA offers excellent care if you are near a major VA center, in my opinion - but I have two other insurance options - disabled firefighter and Medicare.\n\nBeing referred to the department head at a major cancer has been a mixed bag for me.

But intuition can be misleading, and two small European studies reported mixed findings: French investigators did not demonstrate any benefit from a high fluid intake, but Spanish scientists reported that coffee appeared protective.\nA large American study, however, was more optimistic. A 1999 Harvard study of 47,909 male health professionals showed that dilution may be a solution to the bladder cancer conundrum. All the men were free of cancer when the study began in 1986. Over the next 10 years, the researchers kept track of each man\u2019s consumption of 22 different types of beverages as well as the occurrence of bladder cancers.\nWhen the results were analyzed, the men who drank the most (averaging about 2 quarts a day) were 49% less likely to develop bladder cancer than the men who drank the least (averaging less than 1 quarts per day).\nAlthough water was particularly beneficial, all types of beverages contributed to protection, including alcoholic and caffeinated beverages, which had been cited as possible risk factors in some earlier studies.\nAll in all, men can decrease their risk of bladder cancer by 7% for each additional 8 ounces of fluid they drink each day. In a sense, then, the bladder is like so many other parts of the body: the more it\u2019s used, the healthier it stays.\"\n\nFrom: Bladder cancer: Men at risk\nHarvard Men\u2019s Health Watch\nSource: www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/bladder-cancer-men-at-risk ", "date": "2016-12-17T05:48:19+00:00", "topic": "A Study I Liked: Coffee is Good", "subforum": "31-articles-of-interest"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tSean,\n\nWhen I quit smoking I also had to give up coffee - not that I had any choice in the matter.

I made it.\n\nWhen cancer showed up in my one kidney, it became the most important thing. The kidney cancer seems to be gone, but the bladder cancer remains.

My problems started about where you are now. By the sixth BCG instillation, I could count of losing 3 days to just dealing with the BCG side effects. The first 24 to 36 hours were the worst.\n\nI kept going because BCG is the most effective initial treatment for bladder cancer. I kept mine under control for about 2 years, with additional BCG treatments. The cancer would be gone, then reappear, so we stayed with BCG.\n\nIt is important to you talk to your care team about your symptoms, and the side effects you experience. There are a number of things that can help. Ask about pyridium (a urinary pain reliever) and other medications. Doses and timing might be varied to help you recover between BCG instillations. Hold nothing back - talk about how BCG affects you and for how long.\n\nOn your own, find out what helps you deal with the side effects. For me lying down and taking all pressure off the bladder was very helpful, as were hot packs over the bladder area. Hot liquids, once urination was possible helped a lot ( I like coffee, some docs don't - so ask). Lots of cold drinks, including carbonated helped (same need to see what doc thinks).\n\nDo try find was to deal with YOUR symptoms.

I quit for good a few years back, after quite a few periods of non-smoking. A long period of hospitalization and rehab, courtesy of  a drunk driver slamming me into a freeway sound-wall while I was working on the side of the road, ended my tobacco drug habit for what may well prove to be the final time. Having to go to a hospital loading dock to smoke - along with the doctor and nurse smokers - finally convinced me that I had a drug habit.\n\nHaving confessed to my long term voluntary informed choice to smoke despite many medical providers recommendations to stop, upon the diagnosis of BC a year ago I began to learn about BC.\n\nLike you, I read that smokers have \"higher rates of BC than non-smokers\". Depending on source, smokers anywhere from 2 to 7 times more likely to develop BC than non-smokers. A range as wide as \"2 to 7 times\" could not help but catch my attention; widely divergent statistics derived from a common data pool raises red flags. It seems it would be a no-brainer - if you have BC, either you were a smoker or not. The calculation of any increased risk should be straight forward and consistent.\n\nA much cited NIH document found that \"50 percent of all cases of bladder cancer are found in smokers\". What ??? 50% of bladder cancers then are found in Non-smokers. The NIH document continues, \"Former smokers are twice as likely to develop the disease as those who never smoked; current smokers are four times as likely.\" Interesting.\n\nwww.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/smoking-bladder-cancer\n\nThe numbers are all over the map. Simple statistics can be tricky - the results are dependent on EXACTLY how the qualifications are defined (and they are almost never defined in consumer level publications). If there is interest, I will provide somebackground material upon which the stats rely.\n\nBut we can all agree. Smoking is a dumb idea. (and smokers DO like smoking) It is good to quit, better to never start. How much smoking contributes to bladder cancer is open to debate among respected sources.\n\nJohn, you have been a non-smoker for a couple of months now, a couple more and you will start to think like a non-smoker, a few more months and you will feel sorry for those sucking on the weed outside stores and offices. Eventually, you won't even thing about smoking, except once in a long while when suddenly, out of nowhere, you have the thought that a cigarette would be real good right now. I am told that as I get closer to 20 years of non-smoking that the sudden thought will go away too.\n\nHang in there. Just don't buy or bum any smokes. The demons in your head screaming for a smoke are quieting down. Beat them and beat the BC.\n\nBest\nJack\t\t\t", "date": "2016-10-08T16:51:59+00:00", "topic": "Smoking.", "subforum": "17-chit-chat"}]}
