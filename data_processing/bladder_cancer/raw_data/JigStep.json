I'm glad I had it, because I had a serious bleed a few days after a BCG treatment. I think you commented that you were looking around for a urologist. The only thing I can say is you want to be sure that the providers you'll be using--urologist, hospital, anesthesiologist, etc.--are in the insurance carrier's network. Out of network price for my little misadventure, including 2 nights in hospital, would have been in the $20,000 range. Good luck, Stu\t\t\t", "date": "2020-12-03T00:54:22+00:00", "topic": "Florida Insurance Recommendation or ACA info", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tI'd certainly be in touch with medical staff to check in about the situation. I had two rounds of BCG after 9/19 TURBT. Four days after second instillation (about 7 weeks after TURBT), morning elimination consisted of gross hematuria and lots of clots. Situation did not improve as morning progressed and by the time I decided to go to ER, I was only able to pass small amounts of blood and clot. Irrigation via catheter to clear coagulum (ultrasound showed bladder distended and 90% full of clot), emergency cauterization of tumor site, two nights in hospital (they were concerned about falling hemoglobin level), a unit of blood, and got to wear a catheter home for a couple of days.\n\nApparently the BCG irritated the resection site. Nurse Practitioner in charge of BCG said she'd only seen such a strong reaction once before in 4-5 years of working with it.

Between weeks seven and nine, following 2nd TURB, started having some discomfort when urinating (particularly getting flow started), with minor bleeding and passing small clots. Sounds like your reaction is much more severe, but timing seems similar. I don't know if my experience was a reaction to Mitomycin or just the healing process.
