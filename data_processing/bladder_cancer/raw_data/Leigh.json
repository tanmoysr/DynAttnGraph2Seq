No link to the mentioned scientific study but it's green tea right any enhancement to treatment I am willing to take onboard.\n\nThanks Mike for the tip about white tea..I am now having both...the white tea also helps to reduce fat levels which I am happy about. Have been piling on the pounds while on steroids these last few months.\n\n(Message on Forum )\n\n\nHi,\n\nI have an interesting information for you. I am working in hospitals and a colleague of mine, a radio-oncologist, has showed me a study *that was published in the Journal of neurooncology. This study shows that the consumption of green tea increases the efficency of radiotherapy.\n\nThere is an enzym in green tea, the epigallocatechin-3-gallate, that increases the speed of destruction of the cancer cell by 40%. That's what explains this synergy.\n\nMy colleague has told me that this information is not yet known by everyone, even not among radio-oncologists.\n\nI have 3 more tips\n\nWe need 6 cups a day. you let infuse for 10 minutes and you have to drink the infusion less than one hour after its preparation, otherwise it looses its properties.\n\nThe green tea from japan is the one with the highest conentration of EGCE.\n\nTo improve the efficency, you can eat foot that contains omega 3 (like curry, rapsberry, brocoli)\n\nMerry Xmas to all\n\nPS : Sorry for my english, it's not my natural language.\n\n*Journal of neuro-oncology 2006 80(2) 111-121\t\t\t", "date": "2010-02-02T19:09:56+00:00", "topic": "Update...YEA...HOORAY", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tDear George,\n\nHere here!!\n\nThank you for writing this post....\n\nOf course thanks to all you caregivers too!!\n\nLeigh\t\t\t", "date": "2009-11-09T19:12:07+00:00", "topic": "How do we care for our Caregiver?", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tDear Kathy,\n\nI am so very sorry to hear about your FIL.\n\nThis must be  a truley devastating time for you and your family.

I got used to it but any visiting family viewing this when it happened had suprised looks on there faces.\n\nI had a CT scan to check for any problems as my belly became very swollen as it looked like I was pregnant. A build up of fluid was found in my pelvic area and an extra drain was inserted which was a great relief to me as several litres of fluid drained away which relieved the pressure on my belly also.\n\nI also had a PIC line put in my neck during the RC surgery which was utilized to feed me intravenously with those bags of milky stuff.\n\nFor me it was 14 days after surgery when I could finally try food which was a cup of yogurt and custard mixed. The next day I was allowed a bowl of broth and a chicken sandwich which I dipped into the broth as the bread I just could not swollow.\n\nI lost 14 kilos in weight during this time and gradually became more and more active during the following days because of the food nurishing me giving me more energy. Sucking on ice cubes for two weeks did not offer much in the way of energy.\n\nIt was a long road to recovery and on the 21st day after RC I was able to go home. I never expected to stay so long and had in my head that I would be ten days max because of the full open incision. Of course that was if there were no hickups along the way.\n\nHold on in there....for some of us it takes longer to recover because of these hickups.

I guess regular self cathing makes it sensitive inside with the insertion of a tube a few times a day.\n\nOn my follow up exam one month later at my Urology office I was then advised to reduce cathing to once a week which was great news. My Urologist insisted that I kept up this weaning off schedule. The cathing for me was not to urinate as this could be done naturally but only to flush and cleanse the new bladder to prevent mucus build up in the beginning when production is at it's highest.\n\nThree months after my RC and cathing was stopped and since that time I have had no problems that have required me to self cath.\n\nMany fellow patients of RC are advised not to cath unless having problems with urination.

The first few days I used nappies because any sudden movement emptied my bladder and I had little control on stopping the flow.\n\nLuckily my pelvic floor excercises kicked into action pretty quickly and I was able to start and stop the flow as desired. These are also called Kegal exercises and I guess you have been advised or will be advised about these. Everyone has a different experience and sometimes you can have instant control and for some it takes longer.\n\nAs the weeks and months move along incontinence issues improve and within two months I had near 100% daytime continence except for the occasional coughing or sneezing fit. I wear a protection shield in my underwear for security although it really is not necessary for day time but make\u2019s me feel secure.\n\nFor me night time continence depends on fluid intake before bedtime and using an alarm to wake a couple of times during the night to urinate. Very quickly I regained an instinct to wake when I had fullness in my lower abdomen and often woke before the alarm.\n\nPresently I am having adjuvant chemo and all this has gone out of the window temporarily because sometimes I am too tired to wake and have more leaks during the night.\n\nI have two types of shields to wear in my underwear one for day and one for night, the latter has more absorbency for increased urine leakage.\n\nFor many it is possible to have dry nights also and each and every one of us has a unique experience in the continence training process. You will eventually find your own routine that works for you and your personal situation.\n\nPlease try not to get disheartened if it takes a while to control the flow, it is hit and miss in the beginning and patience is required.\n\nI hope this gives a small insight from my experience and please feel free to ask any question you want.\n\nKind Regards\nLeigh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "date": "2008-03-19T18:50:23+00:00", "topic": "Neo bladder repair work....", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tWhat a difference a day makes...\n\nYesterday I was pretty sore and unable to urinate very well and was very worried I would have to return to the hospital to get the catheter re-inserted.\n\nI woke up this morning and had the best pee since my RC in September even though it is still tender I was able to empty my bladder in seconds rather than 10-15 minutes it usually takes.\n\nI am so happy today and my spirit has been lifted and so grateful to my urologist for the work he did on me.\n\nIt is amazing what little things please....but I really have struggled these last seven months with urinating and so happy it is resolved.\n\nWarren,\n\nMany thanks for the advise....crossing one's legs when sitting is also a no no I have found...\n\nThanks everyone for your wonderful caring advise and support you are all very special people.\n\nKind Regards\nLeigh   \t\t\t", "date": "2008-03-19T18:50:23+00:00", "topic": "Neo bladder repair work....", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tHello Lisa...\n\nCongrats on your wonderful news...\n\nLeigh\t\t\t", "date": "2008-02-23T16:07:34+00:00", "topic": "3 month check up all seems clear", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tHello Maria,\n\nWishing you all the very best with your chemo this week...\n\nKeep us updated on your progress!!\n\nKind Regards\nLeigh\t\t\t", "date": "2008-02-16T05:25:38+00:00", "topic": "Treatment begins at last .......................", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tHello Melodie,\n\nGreat news to hear that you are back to work.....\n\nOnce you have settled in to this new schedule it will be the best thing for you.\n\nI am sure the sickness and headaches are just nerves as you get back into the swing of things.\n\nA year out of work is a long time but remember you have been through a lot this last year.\n\nTry not be too hard on yourself and take everything in your stride...you will be just fine  \n\nFocus on you and work and come back and visit when you can...\n\nKind Regards\nLeigh  \t\t\t", "date": "2008-02-16T06:24:03+00:00", "topic": "Melodie 2nd day back to work", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tThanks Joe,\n\nThe clippers are also on standby just in case  \n\nI have the all clear to go ahead with the second round tomorrow.\n\nBlood levels came up enough to go forward which is good...the sooner it is done the better...\n\nLeigh  \t\t\t", "date": "2008-02-15T12:42:36+00:00", "topic": "First round chemo done and dusted...but fold in neo", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tDear Ginger,Pat and Maria,\n\nThank you very much for your messages.\n\nMaria the fatigue was just for the day after the chemo session and to be honest I felt that I could have worked normally except for this day.\n\nMy doctor however signed me off work for the duration of the chemo because I work in a hospital as a food and diet assistant for patients.\n\nThe chemo lowers resistence and my doctor did not want me to take the risk of working with patients that are sick.\n\nThe anti nausea drugs used were zofran with the Gemz and Emend with the Cisplatinum and these worked perfectly for me with no sickness side effects at all.\n\nI was also prescribed Dexamethason which is a steroid and this was given with the Cisplatinum which helps to stimulate eating which it did in a big way.....I was ravanous all the time and have gained a few kilos   The Dexamethason also helps with keeping infections at bay I believe...\n\nI have not been offered injections to improve blood levels although I am aware they are available.

She is a mix of Siamese and Felix type although has the character and temperament of a Siamese.\n\nIt strikes me more than a coincidence that I too have a similar situation with Maddy whom started to urinate all over the house one year before my diagnosis.\n\nI thought that maybe she was getting terrorized by the other cats as Maddy was always a loner and never mingled or played with the others.\n\nShe often showed her jealous nature by striking out at any passer-by when she was cuddling up with me. I guess she was a one man woman in a way and protected me in her own way.\n\nThe urine from a cat is very pungent and cleaning up after her became a chore and I did not want to add this to my usual daily chores even in my at the time good health.\n\nMaddy had the option to venture outside but never chose to do this and stayed indoors using the litter tray to have a number 2 but urinating were ever she so pleased.\n\nAfter many failed attempts at protecting her from the other cats and segregating her to give safe haven I sought help from the vet.  I was advised to do much of the same and to return within a week if she continued. The vet would then investigate further to see if it was a medical issue.\n\nOf course the urination continued and I returned with Maddy to the vet the following week. Visiting the vet with Maddy was always a trauma in itself and tranquilizers had to be used just for checkups.\n\nAfter a series of blood tests, urine samples and physicals no medical reason was found until they completed an x-ray of her pelvic area.\n\nMaddy had large bladder stones and had obviously had lots of pain with urination and sought comfortable places to do her business. I was extremely relieved to have an answer to the problems and after the operation to remove the stones I am sure that Maddy was very relieved also to be pain free.\nMaddy continued to urinate for another week everywhere except the litter tray. The litter tray then became her urination depository of choice\u2026thankfully.\n\nShortly after I too started to have bladder issues although luckily for my partner I urinated in the toilet and cleaned up after myself\u2026.\n\nI am so sure that the bonds we make with are pets/kids have far deeper levels that we just don\u2019t understand fully.\n\nLeigh\u2026\t\t\t", "date": "2008-07-22T02:03:45+00:00", "topic": "A Holly thoughts thread...", "subforum": "7-metastatic-bladder-cancer"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tDear Cynthia,\n\nThe Survivors Conferences and the candle light reading of the names and a keepsake from our community is a great idea.\n\nLeigh...\t\t\t", "date": "2008-07-20T21:32:05+00:00", "topic": "Memorial Page", "subforum": "7-metastatic-bladder-cancer"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tHello Ginger,\n\nThank you for organising this wonderful gesture...\n\nI am sure Susan's family will be comforted by the fact that Susan touched the hearts of many....\n\nLeigh\t\t\t", "date": "2008-07-18T16:56:47+00:00", "topic": "Something  for Susan???", "subforum": "7-metastatic-bladder-cancer"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tHello Lisa,\n\nI am so pleased for you and happy they got it wrong \n\nHurray to scar tissue....\n\nWishing you a pain free treatment Friday...\n\nLeigh\t\t\t", "date": "2008-07-12T17:32:35+00:00", "topic": "Really rubbish time", "subforum": "7-metastatic-bladder-cancer"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tDear Robin,\n\nI would like to offer my condolences to you and your family...\n\nLeigh\t\t\t", "date": "2008-06-27T23:46:52+00:00", "topic": "Sad news", "subforum": "7-metastatic-bladder-cancer"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tHello Lorrie,\n\nI too worried about having my chemo delayed because of low counts.

Sometimes even the nurses did not use gloves to take blood or change dressings because they found it difficult to achieve the task with latex gloves...\n\nEven in my fragile state I became a cleaning freak in my own room and bathroom   I did not have the cleaning goods with me so I used the alchohol dispenser in my room to wipe down surfaces  \n\nLeigh\n\n", "date": "2008-05-27T03:21:17+00:00", "topic": "Hospital Stay?

They really love those dried up corn chips eh!!\n\nIt must be really amazing to have them so close to your home naturally roaming around.\n\nRocky..it must have been a difficult trying time for you recently with your hubby going through chemo...I want to wish him all the very best with his last two chemo's and with your scope.\n\nLooking forward to seeing the pictures of the deer especially the fawn...\n\nBest Wishes to you and your hubby.\n\nLeigh \t\t\t", "date": "2008-05-23T03:16:39+00:00", "topic": "Deer", "subforum": "17-chit-chat"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tDear Peter,\n\nI am so sorry to hear about the loss of your dear friend Tom.\n\nKind thoughts and wishes...\n\nLeigh\n\n", "date": "2008-05-17T17:42:28+00:00", "topic": "&amp;amp;quot;Luck Of The Draw&amp;amp;quot;", "subforum": "17-chit-chat"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tDear Holly,\n\nI am sorry to hear that recent postings on the forum have upset you.\n\nIt upsets me to think that you may decide to leave the forum because of this, although I totally respect you if that is what you decide to do. I never saw the posts in question this weekend although from time to time over the last eight months that I have been a member, some posts have been upsetting to me also.\n\nFrom time to time I have read posts and replies to posts and cringed at the bad attitude and sometimes malice people have written. I strongly believe that this has no place on our forum which should be where we feel safe and free to express our concerns and problems in a respectful manner.\n\nI don\u2019t always reply to every post because sometimes I really don\u2019t know what to say that can help the situation. When I do reply with my own experiences that may be helpful I do so with the hope that my chosen words give support or sympathy in a caring way to the given situation.\n\nThis forum has helped me so much to deal with the problems I have encountered and you have been a fantastic support for me in so many ways. As you mentioned in your post, our forum friends have guided us and supported us and made this scary journey less intimidating.\n\nI will be ever thankful for your caring wise words of support you have given me on posts and personal messages.\n\nHolly whatever you decide to do I will always be eternally grateful for your unconditional caring support you have offered me and so many at the forum.\n\nKindest Wishes\nLeigh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "date": "2008-04-14T14:40:07+00:00", "topic": "Moving on", "subforum": "17-chit-chat"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tDear Holly,\n\nMy sincere condolences to you and your family.\n\nI rarely come to this thread and understand now why you have been away for a while.\n\nTake good care of yourself.\n\nKind Wishes,\nLeigh\n", "date": "2008-03-14T03:29:30+00:00", "topic": "Hollys father passed", "subforum": "17-chit-chat"}]}
