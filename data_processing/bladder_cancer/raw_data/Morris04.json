The compression  stockings don't really work for me,  or  at least not the ones I own.  I had an  RC/Indiana pouch in  2004 (at age 46) and  they  removed several malignant  lymph  nodes.  Since then the lymphadema has continued to get worse.\n\nI  also don't  have far to look if I want  to blame someone. I have not been drinking as much water as I should, and I've gone as long as 7 hours in a day before urinating.  So I'm trying to do better...I also hear from  a massage therapist that swimming would help move the lymph.\n\nI'll let you know what I find out..and if you find a miracle cure, please let me know.\nAnn\t\t\t", "date": "2007-01-10T19:48:36+00:00", "topic": "fliud retention after RC", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\nCongratulations to your  Mom!  I hope she continues to feel good and keep going.  I have stage IV and just stopped looking at the odds. Most of the people I work with have no clue I've ever been sick.  I encourage you to indulge as you always would but let her have her normal life back.\n\nYou're such a dear daughter to care so much how to handle this time.\nAnn\t\t\t", "date": "2006-12-19T04:37:10+00:00", "topic": "Doesn't seem like stage 4", "subforum": "7-metastatic-bladder-cancer"}]}
