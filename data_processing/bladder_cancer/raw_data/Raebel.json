Scary but important.  I found the cystoscopy to be uncomfortable for a minute but not painful. Once the scope is in the bladder I hardly felt it.  The cool thing was being able to look inside your own bladder.  Be sure you can watch on the screen!  In my case, three tumors were immediately evident and even though I Was completely shocked, I was Likely more in denial and found the tumors quite beautiful, like coral in the ocean floor.  I hope you don\u2019t have the same experience of seeing tumors, but the signs and symptoms you are having make it important to check.  Best of luck to you\t\t\t", "date": "2020-06-15T22:42:57+00:00", "topic": "Cystoscopy in a few days", "subforum": "10-women-and-bladder-cancer"}]}
