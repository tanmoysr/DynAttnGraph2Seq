{"signature": ["TURBT"], "posts": [{"text": "\n\t\t\t\tHi Chels,\n\nJust writing to connect as I am similar to you. Young female (33 when diagnosed) with non invasive tumour. Mine was low grade carcinoma removed by TURBT and had chemo in the bladder after surgery. I\u2019ve had one follow up and am due for my second in a couple of weeks.\n\nIt\u2019s very odd for young females to get bladder cancer. Every time a doctor sees my notes they ask \u201chow in hell?\u201d\n\nJust wondering your background. I am a smoker, I know that\u2019s the biggest risk factor. Wondering if you drink energy drinks? Like red bull. My mum reckons maybe that\u2019s it?\t\t\t", "date": "2018-11-07T23:20:55+00:00", "topic": "First three month cystoscopy", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}]}
