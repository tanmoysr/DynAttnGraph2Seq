The purpose of a TURB is twofold.  The first is to obtain tissue samples to be sent to the pathology lab so that an exact diagnosis can be made.  The second is to remove any solid tumors.  Unfortunately CIS does not present as a solid tumor  but instead is more like a rash on the surface of the bladder lining.\n\nA second TURB  is indicated if there is any uncertainty about a diagnosis .   My situation is a good example   The first TURB  showed that I had papillary carcinoma which is like little mushrooms growing up from the bladder lining and these were removed.   The pathology report indicated that these were low-grade bladder cancer but the report also said that there were areas of irritation with some abnormal cells .   Therefore my urologist recommended a second TURB to try to determine what this might be.   During the second TURB he paid special attention to the area where the so-called irritation was found and took multiple samples which were found to be CIS which as you know is high grade.   I then had BCG treatments similar to Nancy and have been cancer free for almost 11 years .\n\nWhile a TURB can remove something like papillary tumors it cannot remove CIS so your doctor is correct.  If the cancer is still noninvasive BCG would be the most likely recommended treatment.\n\nSara Anne ", "date": "2019-01-10T02:36:01+00:00", "topic": "10 years cancer free", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tI too have been on Metformin for > 15 years, 1000 mg twice a day (the max).
