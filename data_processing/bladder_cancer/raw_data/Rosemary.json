BCG is the treatment of choice for CIS, however, we do have a member of this forum with CIS that has only been treated with Mitomycin C and his CIS has been in remission for 7 years.\n\nBCG treatments do not have a standard prognostic response, nor does it have standard side effects.  All results and responses of this therapy are individual.\n\nMy first 4 treatments with BCG were a piece of cake.  After the 5th the burning and bleeding became increasingly worse with instillation.  After the 12th treatment, I developed a severe psoritatic arthritic condition and had to discontinue treatment.\n\nSome people have variable side effects and some have none at all.\n\nBest of luck,\nRosemary\t\t\t", "date": "2008-10-25T23:07:50+00:00", "topic": "bcg how do you feel", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tVince,\n\nI am T1 G3 also.

Having a copy now might serve to only make your panic worse.\n\nInterpretation and diagnosis is what your doctor is there for and that is what you are paying him for.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 40 patients in whom 1 (19) or more (21) previous induction courses of BCG failed received 6 to 8 weekly treatments of 1/3 dose (27 mg.) BCG plus 50 million units interferon-alpha 2B. Additional 3 week miniseries of further decreased BCG (1/10, 1/30 or 1/100) titrated to symptoms without changing the interferon-alpha 2B dose were given at 5, 11 and 17 months. In 12 patients a second induction course was given with 1/10 BCG plus 100 million units interferon-alpha 2B. There was multifocal disease in 39 patients, previous BCG had failed within 6 months in 34, disease was aggressive (stage T1, grade 3 or carcinoma in situ in 31, there had been 2 or more previous recurrences in 25 and disease history was greater than 4 years in 13. RESULTS: At a median followup of 30 months 63% and 53% of patients were disease-free at 12 and 24 months, respectively. Patients in whom 2 or more previous BCG courses had failed fared as well as those with 1 failure. Of the 18 failures 14 occurred at the initial cystoscopy evaluation. Of 22 patients initially counseled to undergo cystectomy 12 (55%) are disease-free with a functioning bladder. Combination therapy was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: While longer followup and larger multicenter studies are required to validate these encouraging findings, intravesical low dose BCG plus interferon-alpha 2B appears to be effective in many cases of high risk disease previously deemed BCG refractory. However, early failure while on this regimen should be aggressively pursued with more radical treatment options. \n\nwww.oncolink.org/types/article.cfm?c=21&s=66&ss=528&id=7905#8\n", "date": "2008-09-16T10:10:06+00:00", "topic": "Delayed Cystectomy", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tThis is a continuation of a discussion that I am moving over from the \"Maintenance BCG thread.\"\n\nIt began this way:\n\nfrom Patricia\nHaving had Dr. Herr as my surgeon i can tell you he probably sees more blc than anyone and he's very no nonsense. His reasoning is along the lines of\n\n\"BCG may not be a panacea for stage T1 disease in the long term, particularly in the setting of rapid recurrence, more extensive penetration and/or carcinoma in situ. Progression at sanctuary sites, ultimate recurrence and progression with time, and issues affecting quality of life (bladder contraction from repeated resections and intravesical BCG) may affect the advisability of avoiding cystectomy. Despite the admonition that a patient's own bladder is better than a reconstructed one, the potential for cure and the qualifications of a reasonably well functioning orthotopic bladder may be preferable to many individuals who otherwise might die of unpredictably progressive disease.\"\nI decided to do my own research on Dr. Herr's research and this is what I have found...I hope to look more into the statistics of other researchers when I have more time.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of 307 patients with high risk superficial bladder tumors who were treated initially with transurethral resection and bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) therapy 90 (29%) underwent cystectomy for recurrent tumor during a followup of 15 to 20 years. Disease specific survival distribution of these 90 patients was determined relative to the indications for and time of cystectomy. RESULTS: Of the 90 patients who underwent cystectomy 44 (49%) survived a median of 96 months. Of 35 patients with recurrent superficial bladder tumors 92% and 56% survived who underwent cystectomy less than 2 years after initial BCG therapy and after 2 years of followup, respectively. Of 55 patients with recurrent muscle invasive bladder disease 41% and 18% survived when cystectomy was performed within and after 2 years, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that survival was improved in patients who underwent earlier rather than delayed cystectomy for nonmuscle invasive tumor relapse.

With repeated treatment there is a risk that the bladder may decrease is size.\n\nwww.bcgoncology.com/treatment/bcg.html\n\nI had a terrible arthritic reaction and I have heard privately from only one other person on this forum who had a similar and terrible arthritic reaction to BCG.

PPD is the skin test for exposure to tuberculosis. More than 60% of patients who receive intravesical BCG will convert to a positive PPD skin test. There is some evidence that those who have a positive PPD or convert to positive PPD have a lower risk of tumor recurrence when treated with BCG. 90% of patients who receive percutaneous (through the skin) BCG will convert to positive PPD, so I often add percutaneous administration to increase the immune response. Surprisingly, people who have had severe reactions to PPD generally tolerate BCG. Nonetheless, there is an increased risk of side effects. These effects can be reduced, if needed, be dose reduction of BCG.

Yes, Dr. Patrick Walsh was a urology resident when I was\na student at UCLA, and later was on staff at the Naval Medical Center in\nSan Diego when I was a resident.\nIt is hard to say if you should receive your next course of BCG or not.\nIt is a risk/benefit question, and both are fairly high.  If you do decide\nto proceed with BCG, which would be a reasonable decision, I would suggest\nthat the dose be very signigicantly reduced, say to 1/10th.  An\nalternative would be to add interferon to increase the local response\n(with lower BCG) without increasing systemic side effects.  If the tumor\nshould return you could be a candidate for MCC (see the Bioniche website\nfor sites).  You might also benefit from KLH.

You need JavaScript enabled to view it.\n\nPURPOSE: We assessed the value of preoperative levels of CEA, CA-125 or CA 19-9 in patients with clinically organ confined bladder cancer to predict pathological extravesical and/or node positive disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum levels of CEA, CA-125 and CA 19-9 were measured prospectively in all patients scheduled for cystectomy for clinically organ confined bladder cancer between September 1999 and May 2004. Biomarker expression was compared between patients with pathologically organ confined disease (pT2 or less, pN0) and patients with extravesical disease (greater than pT2, or pN1 or greater), and between patients with pathologically node negative (any pT, pN0) and node positive disease (any pT, pN1 or greater). RESULTS: Of the 91 patients enrolled, 46 had (51%) pathologically organ confined tumors, 45 (49%) had extravesical disease and 17 (19%) had positive lymph nodes. Preoperative serum levels of all markers were significantly higher in cases of extravesical disease than in organ confined disease. On multivariate analysis CEA with an odds ratio of 8.6 (95% CI 1.51-48.6) and CA-125 with an OR of 29.5 (95% CI 3.6-242.6) proved independent predictors of extravesical disease. CA-125 and CA 19-9 levels were significantly higher in patients with node positive disease than in those with node negative disease. On multivariate analysis CA-125 with an OR of 22.2 (95% CI 3.8-129) and CA 19-9 with an OR of 5.2 (95% CI 1.09-24.76) proved independent predictors of node positive disease. CONCLUSIONS: Increase in serum tumor markers before cystectomy in patients with clinically organ confined muscle invasive bladder cancer is a strong indicator of the presence of extravesical and node positive disease.\n\n", "date": "2006-07-18T00:51:28+00:00", "topic": "Mitomycin", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tI didn't pose that question correctly...\n\nCytology is not an indicator and not a non-indicator...so what is it?\t\t\t", "date": "2006-07-18T00:51:28+00:00", "topic": "Mitomycin", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tDid anyone else have mytomcin washes after their TURB's?

In bladder cancer patients high doses of vitamins A, B6, C, E and zinc (\"Oncovite,\" Mission Pharmacal) when compared with RDA vitamins reduced tumor recurrence by 40%. In a mouse model we found that aged garlic extract added to drinking water significantly reduced growth of transplanted bladder cancer and prolonged survival. For patients with bladder cancer who wish to advance this science I will soon have a study sponsored by the NCI that will evaluate Green Tea and a chemical that blocks growth factors. In prostate cancer, this time in a rat model, we found that moderate exercise, but not excessive exercise, reduced tumor growth.  Bladder Cancer Prevention\nOncovite:Vitamins A, B6,\nC, D, E, Folic acid\nGarlic, Selenium, Green Tea\n\nProstate Cancer Prevention\nVitamins D, E\nSelenium, Soy, Lycopene\nLow-fat Diet, Exercise\n\nYin and Yang\nMedical advice, like any other, needs to be taken at times with a grain of salt. For example, water contaminated with arsenic or pesticides should be avoided, but studies have shown that risk of bladder cancer is reduced with increased fluid intake. Sun exposure increases the risk of skin cancer, but is associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer. Soy is associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer, but may increase bladder cancer risk and the isothyanates in cruciferous vegetables that are effective in reducing cancer risk can, in excess, have the opposite effect. Similar findings reported with vitamin C.

She required no further treatment for her cancer. Today, she is marking her fourth cancer-free anniversary.\n\nShe advises patients to be their own advocates and that they bring someone with them to appointments to take notes and ask questions. \"It's good to have someone else there. Patients can't always take it all in, so having someone with you means that you can review what was said at a later time when you can better absorb the information.\"\n\n\"I give all credit to the Lord Jesus,\" she explains,\"He used Dr. Pruthi to heal me.\" Abercrumbie was especially appreciative that \"Dr. Pruthi walked through it with me.

They have scheduled the removal of the bladder for later this month. What is difference of stage 3 and stage 4 I read that stage 4 is not cureable.

It is good that she has responded to chemotherapy with regression of the disease in her lymph nodes. The general approach, as recommended by her doctors, is to go ahead and remove the bladder because of the increased risk of residual disease there. You can't say that stage 4 disease is always incurable, or that stage 1 disease is always curable.

This strategy is aimed at\nreducing recurrence from the implantation\nmechanism described above and possibly treating\nresidual tumour. Mitomycin C, epirubicin and\ndoxorubicin are the most commonly used agents, but\nadriamycin, thiotepa, cisplatin, epodyl and\nethoglucid are also known to be effective.\nEarly recurrence rates of superficial bladder cancer\n(SBC) post transurethral resection (TUR) remain\nrelatively high at up to 40% at one year. Established\nprognostic factors help identify patients who are\nmore likely to develop recurrence, but all are at\nrisk; even patients with papillary neoplasms of low\nmalignant potential (PNLMP) have a recurrence\nrate of 34% at two years increasing to 64% at 10\nyears. The evidence is that patients who are free\nfrom recurrence at one year post-TUR are more\nlikely to remain free of disease in the long term.\nReducing early recurrence might, but does not\nnecessarily, translate into a reduction in progression,\nbut reducing recurrence alone has clear\nadvantages.....\n......Reducing recurrence begins with a good TUR to\nremove all macroscopic tumour and provide good\ntissue biopsies to allow correct pathological staging\nthat in turn allows the formulation of a suitable\nmanagement plan for an individual. \u2018Single-shot\u2019\nintravesical chemotherapy after TUR for primary\nSPC is becoming standard practice to reduce\nearly recurrences.\nwww.touchbriefings.com/pdf/1599/obrien_lr.pdf\n\nRosemary\n", "date": "2007-04-15T00:12:05+00:00", "topic": "DX", "subforum": "6-men-and-bladder-cancer"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tMax,\n\nTo be honest, I am confused too. \u00a0I have been confused since the very beginning of this ordeal about what is going on and why.\n\nI do know that I woke up from my first TUR with a bag of chemo between my legs. \u00a0 I was told it was Mitomycin C and I got charged by the hospital for Mitomycin C. \u00a0At that time, it was thought that my tumor was the very lowest stage and grade, but lo and behold by the time I had my TUR to check for residual tumor, my Stage had doubled and my grade had tripled!! \u00a0\n\nHowsomever, I have not had any recurrances whatsoever, and so I am feeling pretty glad that I got that dose, and then got one again on second TUR. \u00a0\n\nBTW, I was told by the Urological Surgeon at UNC in Chapel Hill, that anything that grows in the bladder is considered to be cancer.\n\nAll in all, I am glad that I got that dose of Mitomycin C, though I cannot explain what the difference in perspective between various schools of thought would be on this subject.\n\nYour friend,\nRosemary\t\t\t", "date": "2007-04-15T00:12:05+00:00", "topic": "DX", "subforum": "6-men-and-bladder-cancer"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tDear Johnsmom,\n\nI'm so glad you are here.
