I say former because I stopped soon after I was diagnosed with T1HG bladder cancer in late August.  I don't like that I am not a smoker but I understand that the chance of recurrence is higher if I continue to smoke.  That's what I've read anyway and my doctor at Johns Hopkins confirmed the accuracy of the information.\n\nI started smoking probably around 14 or so (middle school).  By the time I graduated high school I was probably up to a pack a day and I stayed there until I was in my late 30's when I started decreasing the amount I smoked.  For the last 10 or so years I've been down to about 6 a day.  All in all I've been a cigarette smoker for about 44 years.\n\nI always said to people that I loved smoking (and I did...do...did) but that I wouldn't be surprised if I was told that I had cancer at some point in my life.  As it turns out, I was surprised when I was told I had bladder cancer, but I wasn't shocked or in any kind of denial.  It made perfect sense to me.  I didn't have any \"why me!?\" moment.  And, while my bladder cancer may have nothing to do with my smoking, it very well could.  I'll never really know.\n\nI don't blame myself for having bladder cancer, even if it could be directly traced to my smoking.  I don't feel sorry for myself either.  I just feel kind of numb.  I am hoping I will regain my enthusiasm for life if I get the all-clear after my second TURBT and BCG treatments.  Right now I just feel like my life is on hold and, I hate to say it, I'm thinking that I might as well smoke again until I know I'm in the clear.  But I also know that smoking seems to interfere with BCG treatments, so I'm in a real fix.\n\nI've thought about vaping or some other alternative form of nicotine delivery, but I know it would lead me back to smoking cigarettes, my true love.  I've thought of just smoking cigarettes but not inhaling, which I used to do for much of my cigarettes anyway in an effort to cut down.  But I know I'd start inhaling a drag or two and would sooner or later be back up to five or so a day in no time.  I thought of smoking again and giving myself a longer period to cut down.  I only gave myself a day or so notice when I quiet in August.  But that plan wouldn't make sense.  Why go back to smoking after not smoking since late August just so I can stop again?  That's insane thinking.  In the end I won't smoke.  I just won't smoke.\n\nIn any event, I just wanted to post something about smoking since I'm sure it has been a subject of interest to many members of this forum and may be of interest to any future members.\t\t\t", "date": "2016-10-08T16:51:59+00:00", "topic": "Smoking.", "subforum": "17-chit-chat"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tThanks Sara.\n\nIt seems like some tumors begin growing in the muscle, for example, and some don't.  Is that correct?\n\nThe reason I ask is because, as you know, one of my tumors was very large and, because of this and the fact that I had two of them, there is a good chance I will have a recurrence episode.  From what I've read the chance that it can come back at a higher stage is a distinct possibility.

One person may not discover a tumor for many months after the first symptoms appeared and the tumor turns out to be a stage 0, low grade.  Another person may find the tumor very quickly and it is a stage 2, high grade.  That is very confusing to me.\n\nI understand the staging of BC, but, for example, can a tumor be a stage 4 without every being a stage 0?
