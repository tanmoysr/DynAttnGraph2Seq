It will be 2x a week every other week for eight cycles. I attended a Chemo Teaching class to learn what to expect from the different treatments.\n\nI will also get one of those port-a-port catheters in my chest the following week so my arms don't become pin cushions.\n\nGood news: CT chest scan did not show a tumor in the lungs. Let's hope the MVAC can wipe out anything that might've escaped. I know the chemo will be rough but I'd rather not risk tumors popping up elsewhere down the road. Discussion about the RC surgery will start after the chemo is finished.\t\t\t", "date": "2017-04-19T17:46:20+00:00", "topic": "Diagnosed 4/19/17", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tHi Sean,\n\nYeah it it's. I still haven't agreed to the RC and am leaning against it so it may not be an issue. We'll see. If I can find an MD who can answer my questions then I'll consider it.\t\t\t", "date": "2017-04-19T17:46:20+00:00", "topic": "Diagnosed 4/19/17", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}]}
