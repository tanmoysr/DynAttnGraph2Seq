I had 3 tumors, one  6 cmt , the other 4 cmt and the other 3 cmt. They were G 3 tumors. I changed the doctor an cancer urologist and he repeated the TUR. One week later, there were no tumors and apparently the muscle was free. So I began with 6 dosis of BCG   In March . I finished the induction in April. I felt very good. I had a cithoscopy in August and the doctor didn't find anything, so I started BCG again for three weeks. The last  dosis was the last week of August . I am very worry because I still have urine disorders, like urine urgency , I go to the bathroom frecuently each hour and a half. I feel tired with some muscles pains. I went to the doctor and he told me that it is normal cause the chronic inflammation of the bladder. My next control will be the first week of December , so please give me your opinion.
