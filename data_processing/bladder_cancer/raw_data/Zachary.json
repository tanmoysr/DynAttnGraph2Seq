Don't leave until you're satisfied that you understand. Believe me, I've been there. Things are happening so fast and so many unfamiliar terms are being tossed around that it's easy to lose focus and lose track of exactly what is going on. When I was first diagnosed I honestly didn't hear a word the urologist said--the room was spinning and I had to lie down I was so close to passing out.\n\nAs an aside, as my wife and I were driving home from the clinic in a state of silent shock, a car ran a stop sign and nearly t-boned us. It's not always the things you think are going to kill you that actually do. At any moment, at any intersection, life may throw you a curveball you'll never see coming. This one--bladder cancer--is at least a curveball you can take a swing at.\nIn my mind I realize bladder removal is probably the best thing to do at this time  to have the best chances of getting it all and hopefully not re-occuring. I am having a hard time accepting that. As I said before, I really don't want to go thru the surgury and recovery period and lifes changes afterwards. I read articles of people with other types of cancer being cured with chemo. Why can't this happen with bladder cancer?\nChemo isn't a magic bullet that kills cancer. It is a systemic solution that kills *all* fast-growing cells, including the lining of your stomach and your mouth. If you had enough chemo to kill all your invasive bladder cancer it would do an incredible amount of damage to your body. And it probably wouldn't kill all the cancer anyway. Again, ask your doctor if this is an option.\n\nNone of us wanted to have our bladders removed, but compared to the alternative it's a walk in the park. Karen's (momof4) husband is, sadly, an example of someone with bladder cancer that has spread to other organs and his bones. If he could talk with you, I'm sure he'd advise you to have the surgery (if that's what your doctors are recommending) while you still can.\n\nSince we're the same age, you might remember the film they showed in Driver's Ed called \n\tSignal 30\n. Signal 30 is the radio call-code police use to designate a traffic accident with fatalities, an accident there is no need to call the ambulance for. Please don't be a Signal 30 out of fear or confusion. If your bladder can be spared, terrific. But if not, there are people here who can help you through this with knowledge and support.\n\nBut please ask your doctors for options and opinions. If you aren't clear on something, don't walk out the door until you understand it.\n\nBest wishes to you.\n\nZach\t\t\t", "date": "2008-04-15T01:21:58+00:00", "topic": "Confused, scared, to many decisions to make", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tNo matter what anyone here tells you, you're going to be very anxious until you get a definitive diagnosis.\n\nThat being said, I think--and hope--that it's an infection or you've been working out too hard or a kidney stone.\n\nPlease do report back.

The panel recommends performing a repeat TURBT prior to intravesical therapy in situations where there is high grade T1 disease without muscularis propria in the specimen and in select cases even when there is muscle present.\n* A single, post-operative instillation of a chemotherapeutic agent may decrease recurrence risk in patients with superficial disease who have undergone uncomplicated resection of the tumor(s).\n* There is no clear superiority of immunotherapy over chemotherapy for low risk disease. Induction courses of either intravesical chemotherapy or immunotherapy (BCG) should be administered in patients with an increased risk of tumor recurrence but low risk of progression.\n* An induction course of mitomycin C in conjunction with maintenance therapy enhances the effectiveness of the drug in preventing recurrence, however, no determinations have been made in regard to optimal maintenance dose, schedule or duration.\n* An induction course of BCG in conjunction with maintenance BCG therapy decreases recurrence and possibly progression in patients with higher risk tumors. Though no determinations on optimal schedule and duration have been made, data is available that supports the SWOG regimen.\n", "date": "2007-11-09T23:33:49+00:00", "topic": "New Guidelines On Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\nDan,\n\nWhile I do agree that the decision is ultimately the patients, I also think that by being in a relationship, You often have to put the other person BEFORE yourself.\nI'm not going to speak for Dan, but what I got from his post was that her husband is *not* going to put her desires ahead of his.

All she can do is what she has done--present the options in a clear and meaningful way.

Sometimes just talking with someone is all it takes.\n\nWrite down every one of your questions and concerns for your next doctor visit.

Zeolite is being touted as the latest MLM snake oil\u2026 at least down here in Southern Oregon where due to high unemployment and a high proportion of gullible wealthy folk there are lot of people involved in pushing MLM health products from Rain Forest Herbs to \u201cglyconutrients\u201d and stem cell supplements.\n\nI was asked by a patient whether they should take zeolite ( a \u201cvolcanic\u201d mineral complex) for their malignancy. A quick down dirty MEDLINE search revealed that zeolite, unlike most MLM scams has hundreds of studies relating to cancer. OOops! I thought for a split second as the downloads started coming that I had been mistaken. Until I started reading them - they are all about how zeolite CAUSES cancer!!\n\nNot only does zeolite cause cancer, it causes pleural mesothelioma. Mesothelioma is the most deadly and almost untreatable form of lung cancer known, and is associated with exposure to asbestos and silicon fiber. The form of zeolite that causes meothelioma is fibrous, and is not the powdered crystal form pushed by the MLMers. But they have been told by their \u201cUPLINE\u201d marketors that zeolite cures cancer (among other things). Like babes in arms the new recruits sally forth promoting a \u201ccancer cure\u201d that causes mesothelioma. Well, ok the \u201cfibrous\u201d form causes mesothelioma not the powdered product. So would you eat ground up asbestos rather than inhale the fiber form? At least have a sales-chat line ready to explain away the embarrassing facts of the carcinogenic properties of the material to people who are not complete morons.\n\nNow, I believe in the inalienable constitutional right of the American citizenry to inflict self abuse by any means, whether high velocity automatic weapons or MLM products. At least as consenting adults in private. What is objectionable is touting them as snake oil cure-alls to people with a cancer diagnosis. And especially my patients.\n\nA single Croatian lab has recently put out TWO lame studies claiming limited antioxidant and anticancer effects for this material. The studies are so underwhelming that one wonders how they were even financed. Half a clove of garlic probably has more anticancer effects than a volcano full of zeolite, and is a lot better for your lungs too. Hmmm. What else is zeolite used for? Well as a silicate based mineral complex (= mud) it has physical adsorbent properties - a little like charcoal or bentonite clay. It can therefore complex certain metal ions, and has been used in industrial animal husbandry (=factory farming) for these purposes. Needless to say, that makes it a miracle \u201cdetox\u201dagent - and detox = \u201ccancer cure\u201d.\nCaveat emptor!\n\n\nI think a good rule of thumb is to avoid any cancer cure sold by multi-level-marketers.\t\t\t", "date": "2007-10-29T18:54:56+00:00", "topic": "liquid Cellular Zeolite", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tDid you notice this at the bottom of the page?\n\n*DISCLAIMER: Liquid Zeolite HAS NOT been approved by the FDA as a treatment for cancer or any specific disease.

Long ago I decided that I was never going to be, and could never be, an expert on bladder cancer. When I read about different diversions or chemo protocols, my eyes glaze over and I often skip them. I'm officially out of the market for procedures. Once you've had yours, there's no since looking for a better one. I have a friend who has never bought a computer printer because he keeps waiting hoping something better and cheaper and faster comes along. This has been going on for ten years! I think we should decide, do it, and not look backwards.\n\nWhat I am an expert on, though, is my particular situation. I have a neobladder (I'm 51, by the way) and have no difficulties with it. In the beginning there was a learning curve, but with a few months I was fine in the day-time. Nights were another matter; I had an additional surgery to install an artificial sphincter and now I'm fine all the time. In time--that's the operative statement--everything new becomes a normal part of your life. My neobladder is a little different than my old bladder, but I'm so used to it now (after a year) that it's second-nature. It requires absolutely no thought. It... just..... works.\n\nIf you do go the neobladder route I think you'll be pleased. If you go the Indiana route I think you'll be pleased. Likewise with the Florida pouch. The Rhode Island pouch I'm not so sure of.\n\nThis is my short-winded way of telling you that I think you'll do well with whatever you and your surgeon decide on.

According to the American Cancer Society, those cancer cases which are most preventable are those cancer cases which occur as a result of smoking, drinking alcohol, and being exposed directly to too much sunlight.  And only about one-third of all cancer cases could be prevented by making proper lifestyle choices. I'm not sure I fully believe the latter, but that's what they say.\n\nThe American Institute for Cancer Research has some very simple (and that doesn't necessarily mean easy or simplistic) guidelines for cancer prevention. Here they are:\n\nwww.aicr.org/site/PageServer?pagename=dc_home_guides\n\n\nIn a nutshell:\n1.  Choose mainly plant-based foods and limit red meat and processed meat.\n2.  Be active every day in any way for 30 minutes or more.\n3.  Aim to be a healthy weight throughout life.\n4.  Avoid sugary drinks and processed foods high in added sugar, low in fiber, or high in fat.\n5.  Do not use tobacco in any form.\n6.

It's tough to whistle a happy tune when that's the not-so-rosy lens you're looking at the world through. But, and I can't emphasize this enough, it does get better, and it can get great again.

Zohner received the first prize at Greater Idaho Falls Science Fair for analysis of the results of his survey. In recognition of his experiment, journalist James K.

Its basis is the unstable radical Hydroxide, the components of which are found in a number of caustic, explosive and poisonous compounds such as Sulfuric Acid, Nitroglycerine and Ethyl Alcohol.\n\nDihydrogen Monoxide is found in detectable and biologically significant levels in virtually all tumors and other cancerous and pre-cancerous growths. Dihydrogen Monoxide itself is not believed to be carcinogenic, although it is known to be a component of a number of cancer-causing agents.\n\nThe chemical compound dihydrogen monoxide (or DHMO) has been implicated in the deaths of thousands of Americans every year, mainly through accidental ingestion. In gaseous form, it can cause severe burns. And, according to a new report, \"the dangers of this chemical do not end there.\"\n\nDHMO is so caustic that it accelerates the corrosion and rusting of many metals and is a major component of acid rain. For those who have developed a dependency on DHMO, complete withdrawal means certain death.\n\nYet the presence of the chemical has been confirmed in every river, stream, lake and reservoir in America.\n\nAlthough the U.S. Government and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) do not classify Dihydrogen Monoxide as a toxic or carcinogenic substance (as it does with better known chemicals such as hydrochloric acid and benzene), DHMO is a constituent of many known toxic substances, diseases and disease-causing agents, environmental hazards and can even be lethal to humans in quantities as small as a thimbleful.\n\nEach year, Dihydrogen Monoxide is a known causative component in many thousands of deaths and is a major contributor to millions upon millions of dollars in damage to property and the environment. Some of the known perils of Dihydrogen Monoxide are:\n\n\n* Death due to accidental inhalation of DHMO, even in small quantities.\n* Prolonged exposure to solid DHMO causes severe tissue damage.\n* Excessive ingestion produces a number of unpleasant though not typically life-threatening side-effects.\n* DHMO is a major component of acid rain.\n* Gaseous DHMO can cause severe burns.\n\nStudies have shown that even after careful washing, food and produce that has been contaminated by DHMO remains tainted by DHMO.\n\nI believe that Immucothel might even contain a minute amount of DHMO.\t\t\t", "date": "2007-08-13T04:48:57+00:00", "topic": "Dangers of Dihydrogen Monoxide", "subforum": "17-chit-chat"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tIn the spirit of my philosophy that when you're doing something you love, in this case laughing, for that brief moment you don't have cancer.\n\nThis is a slideshow of when not to hyphenate your name when you get married.\n\n\n\tClick here.\n", "date": "2007-08-01T19:44:27+00:00", "topic": "Your three-minute cancer treatment", "subforum": "17-chit-chat"}, {"text": "\nZach, you quoted, \"Here--she saved it in a format (.png) that doesn't show up on some browswers.\"  What is (.png)?
