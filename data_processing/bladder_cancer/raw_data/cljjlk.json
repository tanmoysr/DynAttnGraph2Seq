Over the last 14 months I have had three TURB with two diagnoses of Ta High Grade tumors.  I have had 15 treatments of BCG.  Three weeks ago with my quarterly cysto we found another suspect area.  Because of the history of high grade tumors, my Uro recommended and I have concurred that we do another TURB.  We are hoping it is just cystitis from the BCG, but I would rather have the procedure than risk on waiting another 3 months.  I have to agree with the others that once you have a final report, it will be easier to make the recommendation.  However the treatment of BCG is something I would recommend rather than risk the wait and see or the Cystectomy.  As you have probable read here that BCG is no picnic, yet unless you are one that have a severe reaction, it is easier than other treatments of cancer (e.g. chemo & radiation).  So bottom line, don\u2019t fear it, just accept that it is goes with the territory.  Good luck with the treatment and don\u2019t hesitate to contribute here your experiences.

SORRY.      When I was diagnosed with high-grade non-invasive tumor, I was sure that I would lose my bladder.  I went to the Cleveland Clinic for a second opinion.  The recommendation was to start another round of BCG from the beginning.  I had already done a year.  Almost from the beginning, I had side effects of fever, bloody urine and of course pain.  We went to one-third dosage and I was able to tolerate the treatment.\n\nI have now been over two years without any reoccurring tumors.  If my next cysto in January is clean, then the BCG treatment in February will be my last.  My question is, is it common to have joint discomfort from the BCG.  It seems I read it once those arthritis type symptoms are common.  My joint discomfort seems to be getting worse with each treatment.\nI'm 66, now retired and play lots of golf.  Once I'm warmed up, I have no problems.  But getting the body lose enough to play takes much more effort than before.  In addition, if I'm sitting reading, watching TV, on the computer, etc, when I go to get up, I have discomfort and stiffness.  Once I move around some, the discomfort is as severe.  Getting up in the night or first thing in the morning is the worse.\n\nIs this normal reaction to the BCG or am I just walking down the road of life?

If cancer can be happy, I guess ours would be that.  Non-invasive bladder is mostly a nuisance and a life inconvenience than it is a threat.  However, if left untreated, then it would be another story.\n\nI know from experience, that it still does not minimize the emotional trauma that the individual goes through dealing with the diagnosis and treatment.  My first doctor minimized the whole treatment and made me feel like I was a baby when I got upset or overly concerned.  I understand that these doctors see our type quite often and treat patients that are far more serious.  But that does not diminish the emotional trauma we experience.\n\nSo keep you head high, knowing you have support here and hopefully family and friends.  Ensure that you are comfortable with your Urologist and his office.  Don\u2019t be ashamed to express your feelings and ask any questions no matter how trivial they may seem.  If your doctor doesn\u2019t seem to have time or he scoffs at your questions, then immediately change to another physician.

Is this the clinic that you are using?  If so which doctor did you go to?  I live in Palm Beach County and I'm not too thrilled with my current Urologist.  I'm happy to hear that you are getting a fresh start and new diagnosis.  Good luck\n\nChuck\t\t\t", "date": "2008-04-09T22:51:08+00:00", "topic": "found a BC specialist  at cleveland clinic", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tWeek two:\n\nI went in yesterday for my second treatment of Mitomycin C.  I got a different nurse and I have to say she was more experienced and she had fewer problems inserting the catheter.  Went home and did my chicken rotisserie for about hour and a half.  The evening went well with little burning when peeing, but again had a few bladder spasm and they have continued this morning.  Hopefully week two will go as well as week one.\n\nDuring week one, two days after my treatment, I experienced what I thought was a reaction.  I\u2019m now not sure it was.  In any case, I felt extremely tired and had minor flu like symptoms (sore throat, body aches, etc.).  This lasted less than 48 hours.  By the weekend, my energy returned to normal and I felt good.  Perhaps my reaction during week two will determine if what I felt was a reaction to the chemo.  During the week I passed a few blood clots when peeing.  I think that is also normal and to be expected.  All in all, I feel everything is going well.   \n", "date": "2008-02-26T19:49:38+00:00", "topic": "My Eight Weeks of Mitomycin Therapy", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tI'm sorry Rosemary...I don't know why I called you Barb    :-[\t\t\t", "date": "2008-02-26T19:49:38+00:00", "topic": "My Eight Weeks of Mitomycin Therapy", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tBarb,\n\nMy Uro did not tell me nor did I think to ask what he used with my first TURB.  On Monday he placed the Mitomycin directly in the bladder and Yes, I did the rotisserie just like I read those of you that have done the BCG treatment.  I was told to try to hold it at least an hour and preferable longer.  What I have read that some treatments of Mitomycin C can be of different strengths.  My Uro said he would be using 20mg which I understand is the lesser dose.  Perhaps your treatment at the hospital was a higher dose.  I also have read that there are several different drugs that are used for chemo wash, but the Mitomycin is the old \u201ctried and true\u201d drug of choice by many Urologists.  Hopefully, I have answered your questions.

Did your Uro state why he/she is waiting for the third re-occurrence before starting some type of therapy?  Although going through the therapy is no fun, the potential for ending the re-occurrences; in my opinion, would out-weigh the potential side-effects.  At least in my case I am gambling on the odds that I can win at the merry-go-round of re-occurrence.  I started my eight week of Mitomycin C therapy this week.  But the news that your tumor was RaG1 is great news.  Good luck and keep us informed.\n\nChuck\n", "date": "2008-02-15T21:49:14+00:00", "topic": "It's back....", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tSara,\n\nI too want to send my support and prayers.  No matter how many times I am told that the likelyhood of not surviving non-invasive BC, it still is a blow to the emotional stability.  Just like others have told you here, I would tell you to take a deep breath and then move on.  I'm lucky enough here to be close to the ocean and can go there to calm myself and pray. You might go to your favoirte place where your feel you can rejuvenate your emotional strength. Try to remember that our Heavenly Father will never give us more than we can carry.  Turn to Him when you feel the burden is more than you can handle at this time.  My prayers are with you too while you go through this difficult time.\n\nChuck\t\t\t", "date": "2008-02-21T23:49:39+00:00", "topic": "Bad News", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tThanks kinadida...I hope I can say the same thing.
