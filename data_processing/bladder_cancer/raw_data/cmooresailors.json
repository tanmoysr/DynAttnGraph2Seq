I'm a 41 year old stay at home mom / wife I was just diagnosed on the 14th of March with muscle invasive adenocarcinoma of my bladder. I'm in the process of getting on with the many referrals that are necessary to determine the origins of the adenocarcinoma as well as actual staging of it. I've also requested for a second pathology to be performed on samples  at UCSF where all my referrals are being sent . From what I've read it seems like it's a foregone conclusion that because this cancer occurred in the trigone of my bladder as well as urinary tract I'm most likely going to lose my entire bladder and urinary tract. If there's anyone else who has had a battle with this type of cancer in this area and they have any information to share about their experience or advice I am more than open to it and would really appreciate it. There's just not much literature on it due to it being a very uncommon cancer in the bladder.\t\t\t", "date": "2018-03-21T18:22:40+00:00", "topic": "Muscle invasive adenocarcinoma of the bladder", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}]}
