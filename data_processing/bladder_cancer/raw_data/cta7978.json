This may be either grossly visible or only\ndetectable microscopically. There is no correlation between the amount of hematuria and the extent of cancer. Most cases of hematuria are asymptomatic or `painless'. Microhematuria is present in 9-18% of normal patients. The 95% confidence interval for microhematuria in the normal population is three red blood cells/ high-power field. Therefore, patients with more than three red blood cells/high-power field on two or more properly collected urine specimens should be evaluated.\nThe chance of finding a urothelial malignancy does vary with patient age and the presence of gross versus microscopic hematuria. Evaluation of a patient who is younger than 40 years old and has microhematuria has a yield of 1.5-6% of diagnosing a urothelial malignancy,\ncompared with 20-25% in a patient who is older than 50 years with gross hematuria [21], particularly if symptoms of irritability are present and infection has been excluded.\n\nUp to one-third of patients with bladder cancer may present with irritative voiding symptoms such as\nurgency, frequency, or dysuria [22]. These symptoms, although often misinterpreted as representing bacterial cystitis, may commonly occur in patients with CIS or with tumors at the trigone. Gross hematuria should prompt a complete evaluation of the urinary tract. This should include upper tract imaging studies, cystoscopy, and examination of urinary cytology.\n\nCurrent Opinion in Urology. 10(4):291-299, July 2000.\nHassen, Waleed; Droller, Michael J.

I asked the same questions when I was diagnosed, as I understood it I had a 5-10% chance of micro-mets occuring from my tumor.  I wanted to know whether I should go and do chemo based on that risk and was told that it would be overkill.\n\nBasically you can tell what the risk of mico-metastasis is with T1G3 tumors from the percentage of people with radical cystectomies (RC) that had their pathology confirmed at T1G3 post-op.  There are a small percentage of RC patients (with T1G3 tumors) that still end up developing mets even though the tumor (and entire bladder) were removed.  This is due to the tumor shedding cells into the bloodstream prior to removal (via RC or TURB) as I understand it.\n\nI think the numbers were 90-95% 5-year survival for RC with T1, 80-85% for RC with T2, ~65% for RC with T3, someone can correct me if I am wrong.  These figures pretty much reflect the cancer metastatisis risk after tumor removal. (Of course if you do not have an RC, you also add risk of new/recurrant tumors invading and metasitsizing)\n\nOf course these numbers are just statistics, if you have multiple large T1G3 tumors with profuse CIS you will have much higher risk than a solitary small T1G3 tumor, so it is often hard to quantify individual risk from the statistics.\n\nFeel free to send me an e-mail as it looks like your husband has a similar diagnosis to mine, I'd be happy to answer any questions or compare treatment courses.\n\n", "date": "2006-09-25T13:08:30+00:00", "topic": "How to confirm diagnosis &amp;amp; staging is accurate", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tPaul,\n\nHmmm...

Talk to your doctor and figure out when treatment can begin for the bladder cancer.  Most likely they will prescribe a course of 6 BCG treatments, which are not actually invasive.. consisting of being catheterized for about 5 minutes and holding a biologic in your bladder for a couple hours.\n\nSounds to me like you have had all the necessary surgury already, they may be looking to take a biopsy of the TURB site just to make sure they got it all.. however not all doctors perform this biopsy (mine didn't), guess it all depends on how large your original tumor was and how confident they are that they removed it all (and took good margins).\n\nDon't give up hope, T1G3 is still a superficial cancer and some people are cured of the cancer after the first tumor removal.

The stored blood samples from these men and from 111 similar men without cancer were analyzed for several vitamins.\n\nDr. Abraham M. Y.

Rosie - your first recurrences happened within this 2 year time frame as well.\n\nThose who make it through the first 2 years without progression or recurrance, statistically have much better odds of never having a recurrance or progressing... Statistically your risk never actually drops to zero, but for each successive year that you have no tumor recurrence or progression, your overall long term risk (statistically) drops more and more.

Can bladder cancer survivors ever count themselves in the \"cured\" column?\n\nA. As with most cancers, the longer one goes without a recurrence the better. The majority of patients with bladder cancer are initially diagnosed with a non-muscle invasive cancer that can be managed initially with tumor resection via cystoscopy with or without intravesical therapy. These patients however, are at high risk for developing another tumor. The majority of recurrences occur within the first two years. The status of the bladder at the first three-month follow-up cystoscopy is a very important contributing factor to remaining disease free. Recurrent tumors do occur after the critical two year period, though less frequently, and patients should continue to be followed at least annually.\"\n\n\nwww.bcan.org/index.php?name=Emails&op=view&id=8\n\n\nI did talk to a gal who had superficial bladder cancer last summer who had gone 20+ years without a recurrance.. it was a one time event for her.

This website has probably only been significantly trafficked in the last 5 years or so?   Incidence of bladder cancer increases with age. People over the age of 70 develop the disease 2 to 3 times more often than those aged 55\u201369 and 15 to 20 times more often than those aged 30\u201354.

There are other bladder sparing protocols you can look into as well (i.e. radiation + chemo).\n", "date": "2006-07-02T12:35:03+00:00", "topic": "How bad is it", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tYeah, from several studies I have read  it would appear that they can only remove certain lengths of intestines from the different areas without causing damaging long-term side effects (i.e. nutritional absorbtion imbalances).. So, I am not sure a person has enough available material to make a second neobladder?  Maybe they could replace a neobladder with a koch pouch or just a new ileal counduit/external bag.\t\t\t", "date": "2006-06-23T21:40:07+00:00", "topic": "Long term outcomes", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tI'm wondering what the long term effects of having a urinary diversion are?   I am in my mid 30's and I am pretty sure they don't last for 50 years?\n\nI think I have read that many people develop cancer 20-30 years out in the areas where the uretuers are connected to the bladder replacement and other problems related to the age of the urinary diversion.  I understand this might not be a big concern for those of you 55+ or so, but I am interested in finding out what some of the younger crowd has been told by their doctors.\n\nIf I do end up with a bladder replacement, do you have enough spare intestines to make a second replacement sometime down the line?  If you have a neobladder or pouch and it eventually becomes diseased or fails, do they try and construct a new one or do you just end up with a new ileal conduit?\n\nMaybe these things aren't worth worrying about now, but I am curious..\t\t\t", "date": "2006-06-23T21:40:07+00:00", "topic": "Long term outcomes", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}]}
