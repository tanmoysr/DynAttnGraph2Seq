However, I would consider that diagnosis very good news. No one wants bladder cancer, but from what I have read, that was the best diagnosis if you do have it. I am sure your wife was relieved to receive the news sooner.\n\nWe can be 'scope' buddies. I will be doing mine every three months as well. My Urologist did not suggest any injections. How about yours? She said there were too many side effects to do that.\n\nI hope you have been able to get back to the treadmill without any more unpleasant reactions. I injured the knee (again) and must wait until Friday.  I am praying I will be better by then and can get back to running. I have been walking the dogs however, and that is a real blessing.\n\nPraying daily for no recurrence.\t\t\t", "date": "2018-10-09T14:06:08+00:00", "topic": "In the process.....", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tAlan,\nShe did mention BCG, so perhaps she meant if it was muscle invasive and high grade it would be bladder removal not just if it was high grade.   This was said before the procedure and I was nervous but not drugged yet. so I actually asked again after hearing the words bladder removal. My companion was not really familiar with diagnosis, so she said she didn't remember hearing anything else except that either.\nI thought even with muscle invasive there were some options for chemo or radiation. I think there is a site here for reading the procedures for stages. She said there was a limit to how much she could really see with the naked eye and that pathology would determine the result.\t\t\t", "date": "2018-10-19T09:10:00+00:00", "topic": "Had my TURBT today.", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tThank you Sara,\n\nToday the urologist said I had the best possible scenario.

I am sorry you got a high grade after being told low grade, that must have been a deep disappointment.  I am praying that will not happen, but thank you for warning me.  Nothing can truly be known until the lab result. I already had a surprise today when the scheduler said that she always listed them as benign until the pathology was returned. So much for the happy thoughts.\nIsn't the surgeon using the same Cystoscope to do the surgery that is used on the exam? I was told she preferred anesthesia instead of a local, but it would still be outpatient. She said I would not be able to exercise for at least a week. I read somewhere about lifting heavy things ie a bag of groceries, and no normal activity for 4-6 weeks. If that is the case, I would need to have as much information as possible to prepare because I don't have anyone to help me in any way. A bag of dog food alone is 17 pounds, and kitty litter seems even heavier.  I did request the post op information well in advance for that reason. I may be able to have it done in a couple days because a patient canceled.\nThere are many people here that have experienced TURBT and I would appreciate knowing what to expect.

Sometimes she does an injection of chemo during the TURBIT.\n\nI hope to schedule this procedure asap, and wondered what to expect.
