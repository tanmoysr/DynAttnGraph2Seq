I had a similar diagnosis as you including CIS at age 66. I had two TURBT with the last one being Bluelight with Cysview. That is when they found the CIS.

So far all is well.\n\nThe main reason I am responding is to let you know that in my case getting the BCG treatment was not that bad (everyone is different).\u00a0I learned that if I coughed when they reached my prostate it would go right through without noticing much. In my case I never felt my prostate prior to this but after all of the caths (or maybe the BCG) it has never been the same. I have noticed that since I stopped the BCG I am almost back to normal now.\n\nAs of my last visit I am done with the BCG and will just go back every 6 months for another Cysto, progressing to once a year. BTW - During this same period I also was diagnosed with NHL and I can tell you that the Immunotherapy is much better than the Chemo/Rad treatments.

He didn't think but couldn't say for sure? Mine was in my right hip and I used a heating pad (of course it was in the winter, not hot Texas summer) and it seemed to help quite a bit. Over the last 4 years of maintenance treatments it seems to come and go and I'm experiencing some now.\n\nI'm not sure if it is the BCG or just age related (in my case I'll be 70 in about a month). Thankfully mine is tolerable. If you are able I hope you are able to complete your initial 6 treatment because they seem to be very important in beating this disease. In these times we are lucky to have it available, in my case I have had to wait for a couple of months for my maintenance treatments because of the ongoing shortages. It is never a pleasant experience but if we are able to keep our bladders....very worthwhile.\n\nJust an FYI - the BCG, a type of immunotherapy, has far less symptoms for most people that traditional Chemotherapy - I know, I have gone through both (Chemo not bladder related). Both seem to work pretty well and it is the first step in beating these horrendous diseases.\n\nHang in there - it will get better.\n\nPeace and Love,\nDave\t\t\t", "date": "2020-10-14T12:36:54+00:00", "topic": "BCG joint pain side effects", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tThis might just pertain to me but I've found that if I cough as the catheter hits my prostate it seems to go right through - the sting as it goes through the prostate seems to be normal and this seems to work well for me.\n\nIn my case the BCG treatment side effects seemed to increase until about #21 now for the last 3 they seem to have decreased.

Now after my treatment (2 turbt and now 21 BCG) things have never been the same - still some bladder pain and I don't think my prostate will ever be the same. Especially after my last 3 BCG it was dramatically worse. However, I can live with that as it is more worrisome than painful. My treatment was temporarily postponed because I was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma and I could not get my BCG maintenance because my Oncologist told my Urologist that I would need to let my immune system get back to semi-normal first. After having Chemo and radiation for the NHL, it worked out pretty well because at the time there was a BCG shortage so by the time it became available I was kind of back to normal (or at least my new normal).\n\nI always worry and dread before my Cysto and just hope things are OK.

If you happen to live in a area close to a NCI recognized medical facility it makes the choices much easier and after all ease of treatment is a major factor in our medical decisions. I have chosen to use my local facilities versus traveling to a world recognized facility simply because of the logistical and financial impact. But always have that in mind as a option just in case.\n\nIn your case I would definitely consider a \"center of excellence\" and get another opinion before accepting a terminal diagnosis.\n\nFor me the good news is that most treatment protocols are developed and established in those major research treatment facilities through actual statistical results involving large numbers.\n\nI have recently been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma as I concurrently am fighting bladder cancer. It might or might not be a factor with my treatments going forward. The treatments I am taking for NHL do affect my bladder  and not sure how yet. From my experience a lot is just simply unknown and the focus is on treating each disease in a very specific and segregated manner.\n\nIn a perfect world I would hope their would be a round table discussion involving different specialists to come up with a plan of action going forward. Maybe that is just a TV point of view but I do think that is more likely in a major facility.\n\nBest of luck. So far I have been pleasantly surprised by my chemo treatments. Not as bad as I imagined. They have come a long way in treating and managing the side effects of cancer treatment. You might be surprised but will never know otherwise.

After reading your multiple posts I think you are reacting like most of us after our initial visit to the Urologist and discovering that we had an issue.\n\nFrom my short experience (2 TURBT's and 15 BCG treatments) the best feedback I can offer is to relax and let the Dr. do his job. You will not have any idea what you are dealing with until your TUR and pathology report. If you have a Low Grade result then you might not have any ongoing treatment but a periodic checkup. If High Grade, then the Path report will most likely determine you future treatment.

Interestingly they had the \"product folks\" on hand and there was a discussion about the best way to mix the Cysview which seem to be a powder.\n\nDuring my wait the Anesthesiologist came by and asked the normal questions (allergies, previous stuff, etc.) and then off to the OR. Just like my first experience, a different anesthesiologist was in the OR. I asked about that and they just said we work together?? I noticed on the insurance EOB last time they both charged the same amount. Not a big deal (especially since it totally out of my control) just interesting.\n\nIn recovery the Doc came by and said getting the Blue Light was a good thing - he discovered two additional spots not noticed the first time. He showed the pic with white light and the blue light and you actually could not see these under the white light but they were clearly defined under the blue light - almost glowing. They also injected Mitomycin this time and I held for about 1.5 hour. Then I drank a lot of water and waited for most of it to drain before leaving the hospital and heading home. With the Cath still in!! This was Thursday evening and I would need to leave in until Monday morning....OK.\n\nComparing my TURBT - my first (without cath) I had pain after urination (spasm I guess) and very little bleeding and but burning when I went. I took the AZO and that helped and after a couple of days I felt pretty much normal. This time I had bleeding for 2-3 days, lots of clots and what looked like stringy tissue. NO PAIN at all. But this time I slept a lot (for hours) and didn't feel well for the first day.\n\nThe biggest difference was the CATH!!! It wasn't a big deal the first day but after that it really sucked. Carrying around that bag (I chose to use the big bag vs leg bag because I wasn't going anywhere) and constant tenderness and increasingly irritation for the next couple of days. Also the cath got clogged the first night. It felt like I had to go bad the next morning and the pressure finally pushed the clog down the line.\n\nI got the Pathology. This time it was CIS (carcinoma in situ). No invasive cancer is seen. There are items of muscularis propria and no infiltrate into muscle is present. I was hoping for nothing but very glad that it is not invasive!!!\n\nNow scheduled for 6 week BCG starting Jan. 4th - hoping that works.\n\nI am feeling very comfortable now with the Doc. At first I was concerned that maybe I should get second opinion, go to NCI hospital, etc. But from what I read on this forum he seems to being following the same protocol and everyone else. It is so much more convenient to go to Austin versus Houston or San Antonio.\n\nThanks to all the information and comments from my prior entry I was prepared for almost everything that is happening to me. I do wish it would just go away but since it isn't at least I know what I might expect.\n\nThanks to everyone for helping me through this.\n\nPeace and Love - Dave\t\t\t", "date": "2016-12-15T14:12:07+00:00", "topic": "Second TURBT- Blue Light", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tLotech,\n\nSo glad to you are on the mend.

At 12 months, 30.5% overall, 24.3% of patients with CIS (with or without Ta or T1 tumors), and 43.8% of patients with high-grade Ta or T1 tumors (and no CIS) were free from high-grade recurrence.\n\nFor both the CIS and high-grade Ta/T1 only cohorts, there were no significant differences in response rates at 3 and 15 months between male and female patients, patients younger and older than 70 years, BCG-refractory vs BCG-relapsed disease, patients with more or less than 3 prior lines of therapy, number of prior non-BCG regimens, and patients with more or less than 3 prior courses of BCG, Vikram Narayan, MD, of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, reported.\n\nDuration of response also did not differ significantly among groups, Dr Narayan reported. Only in the CIS cohort, patients who received 3 or fewer prior courses of BCG had significantly longer duration of response compared with patients who received more than 3 courses: 12.68 vs 4.96 months.

That\u2019s for every type of cancer (and there are hundreds). This budget covers clinical research on new treatments, long-term research on understanding cancer, and everything in between. The budget for heart, lung and blood disease (the number 1 and 4 causes of death) is even smaller, just $2.90 billion.\n\nThese numbers are little more than round-off errors when compared to the entire U.S. budget, which for 2013 is $3,454 billion.
