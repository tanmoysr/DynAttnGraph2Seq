It was inserted through an existing nephro tube. I had a ton of pain during urination, and it turns out there was a blockage in the stent just above my bladder. The IR doctor had the PA blast some contrast through the nephro tube which dislodged the blockage. With the blockage gone, they removed the nephro tube and patched me up. My first urination was virtually pain free. Over the last few days the pain is back (pain level 3 up to 7).\n\nMy URO said that discomfort with a stent is normal, but now I can't help think there is another blockage since the pain has returned and the flow is a bit weak. My next URO appt is in 3 weeks where he will confirm my readiness for first BCG treatment. In the meantime, I guess the stent discomfort is something I just have to endure. (can;t imagine the pain of having it removed....!).\n\nHas anyone experienced this same situation? I would imagine YES, and I should face the fact that it's just the nature of the experience!\t\t\t", "date": "2016-10-24T00:53:38+00:00", "topic": "Ureteral stent pain", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}]}
