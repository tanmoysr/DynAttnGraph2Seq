This study confirm the results from a large prospective international study published in the Journal of Urology in November 2010. The results of the trial demonstrate that Hexvix identified lesions, including residual tumours, that were not detected with white light alone in 49% of the patients. It also demonstrated that the improved detection of lesions resulted in a significant reduction in tumour recurrence within 12 months. [8] [9]\nOn 12th May 2011 it was announced results from a clinical study included retrospective follow up from 526 patients in a prospective randomized Phase III trial in 28 centers in EU and North America. After a follow-up period up to 5.5 years, the number of patients who have experienced recurrence of their bladder cancer is lower, and the time it takes before the recurrence occurs is longer when they had Hexvix-guided fluorescence cystoscopy.
