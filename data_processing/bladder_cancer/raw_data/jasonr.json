I am in deep south Texas and there isn't anything close by with MD A's  know how and technical expertise.  I have received nothing but the best from them.  My cancer however will not co-operate.  After 4 TURBTs and a round of BCG, I am having a radical cystectomy on Jan. 17th.  I am glad I am going there to have this done. Your husband and I are far too young for this stuff. I was diagnosed at 36.  I hope all is going as well as possible for your family.\n\nJason, 37\nT1 TCC, CIS, non invasive\t\t\t", "date": "2011-10-06T18:02:25+00:00", "topic": "Am I doing the best?", "subforum": "20-caregivers-questions-and-comments"}]}
