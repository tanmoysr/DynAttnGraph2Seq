I'm 49, was diagnosed at 47; I realize I may have this nuisance cancer for the rest of my life, but I plan on that being a LONG life.  I am going to ask my HMO to switch me to a urinary oncologist if it re-appears in August.\n\nI hope your diagnosis is the best possible, and this is a great place to ask any kind of question - we once had a discussion about how much blood is in your urine, and it quickly turned into a wine debate - well, mine was rose', and mine was zinfandel, but MINE was merlot, and mine was cabernet; you will be able to laugh when you know what's wrong, and have help dealing with it! \n\nBe strong, remain fearless!\nLauren\t\t\t", "date": "2008-05-31T01:19:24+00:00", "topic": "Not sure if I have it", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tYou'll have a normal life if you choose to.

He has had sarcoids for 15 years, but they don't spread - I increase his dosage of herbs if I see a few starting to bump out, but they never break the skin, and then they disappear - and there are so many horror stories of sarcoids blossoming all over horses, bleeding and interfering with breathing, hearing, voiding, etc.  We tried chemo (cisplatin), and they got worse, till I tried the herbal mixture.  Makes his grain smell like an Italian meal, actually, but he likes them! \n\nSo I put my faith in the properties of certain herbs, and maybe they are working for me, too.  In any case, something is working - fate, the power of prayer, hope - and maybe burdock root and slippery elm bark!   \n\nLauren\t\t\t", "date": "2007-09-12T20:59:35+00:00", "topic": "Clear check up! &amp;amp;amp; ssiac supplement", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tWoo Hoo ;D  Cytology was clear again, so I can wait till the annual poke and peek in February!\n\nI wanted to mention that I found an organic supplement that has the same 4 ingredients as Essiac tea, and I'm taking it in pill form (can't stand bad-tasting tea..)

Being female and 47, my doctor didn't suspect cancer the first time I had lots of blood, but I had it again 18  months later, and feel very lucky that she referred me to a urologist at that time, and he scheduled me for an immediate MRI and a cysto/TURB the next week. I had a very large tumor, but it was Ta, Grade 0 - and I am going for my six month follow-up next week.   I guess if you are a male and over 60 and pee blood, they figure you for cancer first thing.  But not for younger females.  Especially as young as you.\n\nI was also assured that this type of cancer would not have metastasized into the blood; yet I can't help but wonder what is going on in my bladder for the last six months - did it grow back?  80% of the time, it does.  Is it still non-invasive and low-grade?  Sure hope so.\n\nThere is woman on this board who talks of 16 years and 37 TURBs... wow.  Not something to look forward to, but she's alive, she hasn't lost her bladder, and she has a great outlook.  Even my urologist said that if he was ever diagnosed with cancer, he would choose what we have over all other types.
