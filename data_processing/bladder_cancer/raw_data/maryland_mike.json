There are two uros in my immediate area, and one has a good reputation - he was Chief of Staff at our local hospital. He did my TURBT, HoLAP and bladder stone ablation, then administered all six BCG treatments personally. He enabled me to easily endure the BCG catheters by talking me through using abdominal relaxation techniques when inserting the catheter, thus easing insertion and the flow of BCG through the catheter. This worked well for me. We communicate by email, and he always responds the same day. He didn't hesitate to refer me to a well-renowned head of urological oncology at a large regional hospital when it was determined I need a divertuculectomy and partial cystectomy. All this, after initially telling me he might not be able to treat me because of my doubts I voiced to him about treatments and conditions (after reading a little too much online) - he promptly suggested a second opinion, which I got from that head of urological oncology, who was in complete agreement with my uro's treatment regimen.\n\nI already am very grateful to my local uro, and think he is worth much more that what Medicare is paying him. Perhaps you can simply ask your uro if he could spend some time discussing your case with you.

I was raised in Klamath Falls! Left there in '65, but my 94-yr-old dad is still there. I went to Oregon State in '62-'64. Welcome to the club!\n\nI was just diagnosed with non-invasive papillary carcinoma (grade Ta) in September this year. I've already had TURBT and am on my 4th BCG treatment. I think it's absolutely wonderful you got on an insurance plan, as I know my care will be of significant cost over the long term. Fortunately, I'm now on Medicare (age 67) with excellent secondary insurance, so the financial part is the least of my worries.\n\nAbout costs: My TURBT was over $7k (as outpatient in hospital), and each BCG treatment is around $400 (of course, Medicare doesn't pay near this much to the providers). Since the normal BCG treatment regimen is 6 initial weekly treatments, followed by maintenance treatments in groups of 3, plus additional cystosopies and possible TURBTs, this could get quite expensive over the years - and I am determined that this will be many, many  years for me.\n\nIf you enter BCG treatments - I am keeping a running account how I react to them in a thread on this board (\"Newbie - I'm checkin' in\").\n\nCheers - Maryland Mike\t\t\t", "date": "2011-11-03T21:01:29+00:00", "topic": "Cost?", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\npemquid wrote:PST--\n\nFirst, congratulations on the pathology report results! It's difficult to deal with the emotional roller coaster when you are first diagnosed and starting the bladder cancer \"journey.\" But, at least you have your good news before the holidays, and can perhaps begin to relax a bit now.\n\nIt sounds to me as though your urologist is following the standard and solid protocol for tumors of this stage/grade and number. I initially had a single tumor of the same type as yours, and it was only when I had a recurrence of 2 very tiny tumors 2 years later that my urologist recommended BCG. I was doubtful about that since I'd read BCG wasn't considered all that useful for low-grade tumors. I called my cousin, a radiologist specializing in the urinary tract, who works at a major NY teaching hospital. He concurred with my urologist's BCG recommendation.  Since the recurrence was in a different area of the bladder than the original single tumor, the way my cousin worded it was that \"the recurrence indicates your bladder lining wants to grow tumors.\"  I've just completed the full treatment protocol for BCG, and am doing great.\n\nHope your future check-ups are \"all clear,\" but know that if you do have a recurrence BCG may be the way to go\n\nAnn\nPST and Ann - I'd like to add a 2nd doctor's comment on multiple tumors. I went to the Chief of Urological Oncology at a very large regional hospital for my 2nd, and after reviewing my case (Ta,Mx, Nx) and TURBT photographs, he said \"since you have multiple areas with papillary carcinoma, I consider your entire bladder to be at risk\" - and thus he agreed with my local urologist on using BCG therapy for me (I have non-invasive low-grade tumors). I agree the literature shows BCG to me more effective against CIS; however, I see writings and studies that show effectiveness of BCG against Ta is better than other intravesical treatment options. I'm very happy with my treatment regimen - I'd rather be aggressive than passive on this one.\n\nCheers - Maryland Mike\t\t\t", "date": "2011-11-29T18:08:15+00:00", "topic": "My TURBC is over", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\nPST wrote:I got a phone call with my pathology results today: Stage TaNxMx, Grade 1. Some biopsies were done of the rest of the bladder and there were no signs of Tis. There was a second tumor just getting started next to the first, but otherwise I guess things couldn't be much better. I was told to come back in three months. The doctor does not recommend a repeat TURBT or intravesical therapy under these circumstances. I would be interested if anyone regards this as unsound advice with low-grade non-invasive disease, but two adjacent tumors. It sounds like Maryland_Mike's doctor would agree with mine about BCG because the tumors were in one area.\n\nThis is all great news and I ought to be elated, but I feel strangely down, maybe because I psyched myself up to get through this and have deflated a bit now that the crisis is over.\n\nIt sure is nice to have people to tell who understand what you're saying.\n\nPST - That's good news regarding your staging and classification data! Hopefully you will remain in a stable condition for years to come. To reinforce your urologist's decision to wait for intravescial therapy and monitor your condition, I offer this segment from the NIH National Cancer Institute's discussion on Stage 0 (Ta,N0,M0 and Tis,N0,M0) bladder cancer:\n\n\"Intravesical therapy with thiotepa, mitomycin, doxorubicin, or bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) is most often used in patients with **multiple tumors or recurrent tumors** or as a prophylactic measure in high-risk patients after TUR. Administration of intravesical BCG plus subcutaneous BCG following TUR was compared with TUR alone in patients with Ta and T1 lesions. Treatment with BCG delayed progression to muscle-invasive and/or metastatic disease, improved bladder preservation, and decreased the risk of death from bladder cancer.\"\n\nSource: www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/bladder/HealthProfessional/page5.\n\nThe NIH NCI website has lots of information and references on our affliction.\n\nCheers - Maryland Mike\t\t\t", "date": "2011-11-29T18:08:15+00:00", "topic": "My TURBC is over", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tHello, Alan - just wanted to let you know that after my HoLAP (Holomium Laser Ablation of the Prostate) on 9/30 to widen the path of my ureter through my prostate, I bled for over one month before stopping. My urologist had to wait to start my BCG (Ta, non-invasive with multiple sites) because of that. I'm now rounding 3rd and heading for home on the BCG treatments (two to go), and my urge to urinate is still sudden and strong, but the slight bouts of incontinence I had during the first month are gone.

When I started passing visible blood earlier this year and had a CT, a large (3cm) bladder stone was found. My first cystoscopy showed a very narrow path for the ureter through my prostate, which was obviously restricting my urinary flow and causing incomplete voiding of the bladder. I had a \"trifecta\" (Stone ablation, HoLAP ablation of the prostate, and TURBT) in one OR table visit - and here I am with Ta non-invasive in many places in my bladder. Does the urologist suspect pooling of urine in the bladder for the stone and the carcinoma? \"Quite possible, but not definitive\", he says.
