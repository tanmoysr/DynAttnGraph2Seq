As you recoop your digestive system wakes slowly.  I spent a few weeks with mostly liquid bowel movements.  That is painful.  Use wipes to help.\n\nHow long before you return to work?\nMine was 10 weeks, I had a couple of Urinary Tract Infections (UTI) that prolonged things.  It's common and I've had 3 more since but now they just knock me down for 1-2 days.\n\nWhat do you do for work?\nReal Estate Broker so mostly office work.\n\nCan you run, ride a bike, lift weights, or swim?\nYes to all.  I was a bit nervous about the weights but found no problem.  I'm not power lifting but do 3 sets of 15.\n\nIs walking around comfortably normal?\nPerfectly normal... Early on my wife had to remind me to stand up straight since I found myself slumping.\n\nDo protective garments show through clothing?\nI wear a very thin female pad during day and perhaps twice a week I am glad I did as I get that small \"leak\".  Nothing shows so have no fear.  In reality it would only cause a small wet spot in my underwear but I feel safer that way.  Evenings I wear a Depends underwear.  I am having issues with getting my bladder empty when I void (pee).  For the past few weeks I have been using a catheder before bed and once during the night.  Don't let the thought of inserting a small plastic tube in your penis to empty yourself freak you out.  Originally I did but really it does get to be very routine.  I am headed to my Uro next week to take a look inside to see if there is some physical reason I can not empty.

I have been updating my story \"Life with a Neo-Bladder\" under the Storyboard.  I pulled a clip from my last which discusses sex and Viagra.  I found straight forward sharing and information helpful and offer the same to those who want it.\n\n\nOK... move on... One of the huge benefits I find in this site is the feeling of not being alone.  Reading about others that are or have experienced similar feelings or events.  For this reason, I am going to move on to the subject of sex.  Men... I know this is a subject we avoid but is always top of mind.  Since I was terrified, I wanted to share and hopefully help someone down the road.\n\nAt my 6 week checkup the Dr asked asked if... as he said \"Any signs of life down there?\"\n\nMy wife and I had yet to try.  Doc said it was time to start breathing life back into it.  I did have a nerve sparing surgery and My Uro recommends a routine of 25mg Viagra daily to help with recovery.  He suggested a full 100mg dose and then get busy at least 2 to 3 times a week.  My wife was on her way out of town for a long weekend so all we could do was look forward to a good homecoming.\n\nWell... being the man-pig I am and also being a LOT nervous about ability, I thought I'd just give things a \"Test\" run myself.  The reason I tell my story is because while I did take the Viagra... the results were not what I had hoped for.  In about 45 seconds I proceeded to have what felt like a very weak and totally un-satisfying orgasm and there was no erection what-so-ever.  Now I was really scared!  Was this what sex was going to be???\n\nObviously I was very upset and concerned.  What was my wife going to say when she came home and we tried with similar results!  After a day, I decided to give it another try.  The outcome was only slightly more encouraging.  Perhaps 30% erection but similar feeling for an orgasm.\n\nWhen My wife got home, it was getting late and I had an appointment with the Uro the following day so the homecoming celebration was put off (whew).  In the morning, as we woke up I just felt like I could.  Long story short... I could not and that's when I explainied that I had tried over the weekend.  She was very supportive and understanding but deep down I'm sure she was wondering herself.\n\nAt the Uro that afternoon, we discussed exactly what had happened.  He looked us both in the eye and said \"Just keep working at it.  You've been through major surgery and it may take a some time.  The fact that you had some erection is a step in the right direction.  You didn't wake up from the surgery and start running down the hall... everything is little steps.\"\n\nI knew that if things did not work properly there were many treatments to comsider, but like any one, I wanted things to be as close to before a possible.\n\nLater that evening we decided to try again.  I wanted to take some pressure off and for me that's relaxing her first.  With that behind us things just seemed to progress naturally.  Now I'm not going to claim 100% on the erection side that quickly but my fears about a very mild and un-satisfactory orgasm were put to rest.  Since then... things are getting better every time.  Small steps lead to great success!\n\nMen... be patient.  I'm sure there will be some fear but be patient.  Also REMEMBER... while your partner may not share this with you, they are VERY nervous about touching you.  They do not want to hurt you and may be very timid.  Let them know that you are fine and lead them if you must.\n\nAgain, I write this in hopes of helping someone understand that they are not alone.  The unknown creates the greatest fear.  When my Uro reminded me that this was a journey that takes some time, I just felt better.  My concerns faded and I was ready to keep working at it.  Do not give up and remember... attitude is half the battle!\n", "date": "2006-10-18T20:34:45+00:00", "topic": "Questions to ask the urologist", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tTim,\nGreat to hear from you again!

Cysectomy is a no turninig back decision.  Let me tell you why I made the decision I did and perhaps you can pass this on to him.  While I did read and see all kinds of stats and reports the one thing that came through was that not one of those people in the studies was ME.  Each patient has circumstances just a bit different than the study group so how could I possibly make a choice from those reports.\n\nMy local Uro took an aggressive approach.  I had 5 tumors staged T1-G3 with CIS.  He talked with me about several different options but leaned hard to cysectomy.  My 2nd opinion was through John Hopkins in Baltimore (known for BC specilists).  This Dr glanced at my path report and told me what they do.  No discussion, no input just talkinig at me (see complete story in the \"Storyboard\").\n\nWhen I returned to my local Uro we chatted somoe more and it boiled down to a fwe simple facts.  CIS is aggresive and not predictable.  T1 while classified as \"Superficial\" can turn to T2 at any moment.  When I was re-staged, things looked good and I could have very easily gone the BCG route but my Dr looked me in the eye and said when it comes to Bladder Cancer, we deal in 5 year survival rates.  Mike, you're 45 years old and I would rather talk with you about 25 or 30 year survivability.  There is no guarantee with anythhing but cysectomy early rather than late showes slightly better results.\n\nNow I am a gambler.  Love to play Craps but I was lookinig at reports that showed survival rates from 2% to 10% higher with early cysectomy.  That's 90% - 98% \"No reason to jump into it\".  I was not willing to gamble even a 2% chance when it came to life.\n\nI am 5 weeks post-op RC with a Neo-Bladder.  It has not been a piece of cake all the way, but I would not have changed a thing about my choice.  While I do have to return for periodic checks I am not living with the same concerns that I would had I opted for BCG.

My two cents in the ring says that if your original Dr can't help the situation after one try says it's time to look to others.  As Lou says, I too beleive that we have to take the bull by the horns and not only understand what is happeninig with our body but also exactly what the Dr intends to do to solve it.  If it makes sense, move forward.  If not, ask more questions.\n\nWhile I was recovering from my surgery in the hospital I was not comfortable with one of the evening nurses and how she wass handling a situation.  After some discussion I finally said, \"I'm sorry... and do not take this personal but this is my only chance at a semi-normal bladder (neo-bladder) and I am not willing to take chances.  I am asking that you either get your supervisor or leave the room and I will take care of things myself but I will not wait till morninig when my Dr. does rounds (as she was suggesting).\n\nLynne, I do wish you all the best... never stop looking for the right solution.\n\n", "date": "2006-09-08T15:01:08+00:00", "topic": "Cancer of my Urethra?", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tShirley,\n\nThank you for sharing.

I am 4 weeks post op and having similar stool issues.  One week ago I was actually keeping things solid with only two movements a day but then I took on an infection of sorts.  I could not eat and was back to the basic liquid diet for 3 days.  This sent my bowels back to, as my wife says \"Loose Tail\" mode.
