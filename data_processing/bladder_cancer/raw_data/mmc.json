I had my bladder out and got my replacement (made from my intestine) almost four years ago.\n\nAs Sara Anne said, get to a top bladder cancer center for the 2nd opinion.  You want a urologist who does more than 50 a year MINIMUM.  AND you want one who does them for women with high frequency.\n\nMost often, the Indiana Pouch is the best option for women.  Neobladders are done for women and many have lots of success with them but they also have much less success statistically than men.\n\nOne reason is that women have a shorter urethra.  This can cause problems with continence.  Also, there are often other complications which can mean you would have to catheterize yourself either intermittently or long term.  There is increased risk of infection just due to plain old anatomy and it is a pain to catheterize your self when you are female.   With an Indiana Pouch, they create a new bladder but rather than connecting it to your urethra they create a hidden stoma in your belly button.  Then you use a catheter to drain it.  It does mean you will pee standing up and that has emotional implications from other women seeing coming out of a stall.\n\nLots to learn but the key is getting to the top place.

It does make sense to look and see before going in for the surgery but not if it will cause excessive delays.  They do know there is a mass.\n\nYour doctor should not have said it was cancer.  That just causes panic prematurely.  It could be something else.  However, I also don't want to get your hopes up because tumors like that tend to be cancerous.  Grade and stage mean a lot though.\n\nPersonally, I would suggest getting to a urologist at a major bladder cancer center if at all possible for your follow up.  I don't appreciate a doctor being so cavalier with the cancer comments.  Mine told me originally that mine was \"likely cancer\" when he did my cystoscopy.  It looked just like CIS and that is what it wound up being.  He tried to get me on the surgery schedule for the following week but I was going to be traveling out of the country for a couple weeks.  He said it was OK for me to go but to get scheduled for as soon as I was back.  I'd rather have a doc that explains things that way.\n\nLots of us here have had bladder cancer of various stages and grades.  We are still here to talk to you about it.  Please understand that, even if you do have it, it is not necessarily a death sentence.   First step is get it looked at and then (likely) get the tumor removed.  Then a pathology report to see if it is cancer and, if so, how aggressive is it (grade) and how deep is it (stage).\n\nWe are here for you in the mean time.\n\nMike\t\t\t", "date": "2012-06-23T14:56:01+00:00", "topic": "Scared and confused", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tCongrats on no muscle invasion.

People vary in healing times and those that have symptoms longer after a turbt tend to be the ones who heal a bit more slowly.  No worries though.  They will just start it a little later.\n\nYou might want to ask the doc about antispasmodics or pyridium (bladder analgesic) to see if that helps with frequency.  If you typically take any kind of aspirin or blood thinners, talk to the doc about that as well as they may want you to stay off of them for a bit.\n\nMike\t\t\t", "date": "2012-06-20T13:10:06+00:00", "topic": "Question about restageing surgery", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tRich,\n\nGlad it went well!

Unless you are WAY farther along that most folks before they found it, there are a number of things that are used for treatment before that.\n\nChemo (in the traditional sense) is usually only if it has spread or there is a high likelihood that it already metastasized. With bladder cancer, if it is contained to the bladder, getting it removed is usually the worst case scenario and that's not such a terrible thing.  Had mine out for over 3.5 years now.\n\nAlso, they can instill mitomycin (technically a chemo agent) into the bladder directly so it has NONE of the various side effects of \"chemo\" when it is put through the blood stream.\n\nEven more likely is BCG (live TB vaccine) that is instilled in the bladder over a period of six weeks (once a week) and then a maintenance regimen of 3 weeks every 3-6-12 months (gradually increasing over a few years).  This is not even chemo.  It causes your bladder to have an immune system response which kills bladder cancer cells.\n\nFinally, if it is non-invasive and low grade (after they take the tumor out), your treatment could wind up being \"Come in for a look see every three months\".\n\nDon't get ahead of yourself in the treatment concern.  There are lots of possibilities and most of them are WAY better than what you are thinking.

Time to start studying up on the surgery and getting prepared.\n\nMany of us here have been diagnosed years ago and we're still here.  That should give you some idea that bladder cancer doesn't always mean death.  I will not lie and say it never means death either, because it can.\n\nAs Pat said, get the CT report from the hospital.  If that is not available to you in Greece because of your laws being different, then get on the phone with the doctor and ask him to go over the report with you in detail.  If the bladder cancer is in the muscle wall, then surgery right away is certainly the right direction.  You need to know if anything was seen outside of the bladder and how far into the bladder wall it has gone.  If it has gone deep into the bladder muscle then your husband will most likely require chemotherapy after recovering from the surgery.\n\nMany of us here have had the surgery (myself included) and still others had both the surgery and the chemo and they are still here and posting.  Others aren't her posting but they are out in the world going about their business and have put bladder cancer behind them.\n\nIt is certainly a scary time for both you and your husband (and I'm sure your loved ones as well).  Count on the support of your family and let those who want to help do so.  You and your husband are going to be busy with the surgery and recovery so graciously accept offers of help.  It lets those around feel they are contributing at a time when everybody (not just the two of you) feel helpless.\n\nBe there for your husband during the surgery and recovery (but be sure to get enough sleep and take care of yourself).  You don't want your husband to spend a lot of energy having to worry about you (although he will no matter what you do).  Even if he wakes up while recovering and sees you sleeping in the hospital room, he will smile and his heart will swell because you are there for him.\n\nAfter the surgery, get him up and walking by the next day at the latest.  Even if it is walking in place next to the bed.  Walking wakes the intestines back up sooner.  So does chewing gum which can be done right after waking up (but no swallowing the gum).  The first day, he may even feel like \"Hey, that wasn't as bad as I thought!\".  Don't be fooled by that.  Sometimes the anesthesia keeps working for a while and the pain doesn't really hit until day two.  Walking, walking, and more walking are the key.  He won't feel like it but tell him now that of the people who have been through what he is about to go through, we say walking is the key to recovery.\n\nI wish you both the very best of luck!

We assume that it is just a cough.

Blood and urine tests are the first things used in determining if there is a problem with the kidneys.  There are lots of things OTHER THAN cancer that are possibilities. A CT scan or MRI is another diagnostic tool to look at the kidneys.  Most likely, the CT scan she is getting will look at the bladder and kidneys and surrounding tissue.\n\nDiabetes (as Pat already mentioned) or high blood pressure can lead to kidney problems.  Has your mom been generally healthy?  Has she been on any medication that requires keeping an eye on the kidneys?  Lots of medications can cause problems with the kidneys and many of those are minor or require a dosage adjustment or a different medication.\n\nAs to which is worse.  Not sure.

Many of us have had our bladders removed so we know about the surgeries.\n\nThere are many women here who can also tell answer whatever questions she may have as related specifically to women.\n\nIt sounds like UC Davis is her 2nd opinion doctor and if so she already miles ahead of some people by getting to 2nd opinion doctor as soon as possible after diagnosis.\n\nPat will probably be on with information about UC Davis and the doctor's there.  She's done lots of research and is the best source of information on doctors/hospitals (and quite a lot of other stuff, by the way).\n\nThe key is LOTS of experience doing the surgeries and the particular type of diversion that your sister chooses.\nThere are options these days as they can make a new bladder out of intestine.  Many times, women will get what is called the Indiana Pouch.  The segment of intestine is formed into a pouch and a stoma is created that goes to the navel (or near it if it can't be done at the site of the navel for some reason).  Then she would just put a catheter in it to drain it periodically.\n\nAnother method is an ileal conduit.  That's the one that been around for a long time where the ureters are connected to a stoma and a bag is connected outside the body to collect the urine.\n\nAnother is the neobladder.  Similar to Indiana Pouch (named that because that is where it was invented) but it is connected to the urethra.  This is riskier for women than it is for men because women have shorter urethras.  Also, many times those of us who have neobladders wind up in situations where we have to catheterize ourselves either periodically or every time we go (depends on possible complications from the surgery).  If women have to catheterize, they have a higher risk of infection if they are going through the urethra.\n\nPat has an Indiana Pouch so she can tell your sister all about that as well.\n\nSorry that your sister has this diagnosis but there are lots of folks here who have \"been there/done that\".  We've educated ourselves and are happy to share what we know and/or have experienced.\n\nLet her know she's not alone.  There are many, many bladder cancer survivors.  Living without a bladder isn't really hard to do these days.  I'm sure she will have tons of questions and we're here for her (and you).\n\nMike\n\n<I had said Pat will probably be on and then when I posted, I saw that she already posted.

They indicated that there was a higher incidence of bladder cancer in patients who had a TURP.  Kind of like it's the TURP's fault.  My theory is that the people who get a TURP are the ones who are fed up with the urinary frequency and urgency issues and therefore they have the type of BPH that constricts the urethra.\n\nTherefore, men with BPH that constricts the urethra should be more vigilant about other symptoms and more closely watched by a urologist OR should be treated for that condition sooner in order to reduce the increased risk of bladder cancer.  That could prevent some occurences and cause others to be caught sooner.\n\nAgain, my point is that it is the lack of complete voiding on a regular basis (regardless of the cause but in men the primary cause is BPH) is the true culprit.  Lack of complete voiding means that any and all carcinogens, that the body tries to filter out, sit in the bladder exposing its surface to higher concentrations of carcinogens for longer periods of time.\n\nI know I had about two years of UTIs that were not UTIs prior to finally being diagnosed.  Had I been informed by my GP that having the type of BPH I had could increase bladder cancer risk and that if I got unexplained UTIs....\n\nDo we have any urologists that act advisors to ABLCS?  If so, maybe we can give them the same idea for a study.  I think this could actually do some good for some people in the future.  Of course, I could very well be wrong.

Not a sure way to check but at least if you are a different blood type from the other person that had their's done the same day.\n\nWhen I went to MD Anderson, we stayed at a Hilton simply because I travel a lot on business and had enough points to stay using points.  Used airline miles for free tickets also.  That stuff came in really handy.  When I had my surgery in Denver, my wife was able to stay at the nearby Hilton for the whole time using points.  Used them all up though.  The plan was to use that stuff for vacations but it sure saved a lot for us when we didn't need to add money problems to everything else we had going on.\n\nHopefully, some folks that have been there can chime in with recommendations on places to stay.

In reality, my local urologist highly recommended that I get to a major bladder cancer center and recommended a couple as soon as I had positive cytologies two years after my initial CIS diagnosis and treatment.\n\nBased on what I've read in posts here in the forum, I get the sense that many people are concerned with insulting their urologist and in some cases urologists may be trying convince patients that they know better than the major bladder cancer centers.\n\nIn any case, that line of thought led me to these random thoughts about a hypothetical letter (or conversation) with a local urologist after a diagnosis of bladder cancer.\n\nMike\n\nDear Doctor,\n\nPlease understand that I am obviously shocked and dismayed by my recent diagnosis of bladder cancer.\n\nPlease understand that my questions are not intended to cast doubt on your knowledge or expertise.  For me to feel that I have some sense of control over my situation, I want to gain as much knowledge as possible so that I can make informed decisions.

You may feel a genuine sense of loss but I will be dead.\n\nPlease understand that my desire to seek a second opinion doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t like you or trust you. In a way, I don't really even consider it a second opinion. I believe your diagnosis and think it would be good to take things to the next level of specialty.\n\nWhen I ask questions about how many surgeries of this type you perform and how frequently, it doesn\u2019t mean I think you are not competent.  Even if you have less experience dealing specifically with my exact type, stage, and grade of bladder cancer than other doctors, you may very well be much more highly skilled than they are.\n\nIf you were planning to build a house on a cliff, would you most likely go with a construction company that has a lot of experience building houses on cliffs, is specifically focused on the science and engineering of cliff building, and has an excellent track record or a company that builds on the plains but has built a few houses on cliffs but done an excellent job?\n\nA major bladder cancer center may come to the exact same conclusion with regard to diagnosis and treatment.

As my GP covers all things in general, you cover all things urological.  I now think I need someone who covers all things related specifically to bladder cancer. It is simply a matter of focus and specialties within specialties until I reach the lowest level of focus.\n\nIf a family member or close friend told you of this same diagnosis, what advice would you give them?

However, you want to do that quickly.  Most will want to do things themselves (cysto, TURB, etc.) rather than just taking reports.  This results in better outcomes for patients because they have more experience doing these things than local uro's.\n\nNot sure that \"treating people my age\" is as important as \"treating people with bladder cancer on a daily basis\" but that is certainly your call.\n\nSome of the best docs know they are the best and are cocky.

After the treatments, do not be any less vigilant.  Keep up with the regular cystos.\n\nOne thing about this type of cancer is that if they catch it early, they can do something about it.  Mine was CIS (kind of liquid cancer) and I had problems with BCG and mitomycin treatments.  It wound up coming back after two years and pentrated the wall.  For MANY people, it doesn't come back and the BCG teaches your body how to deal with it.  Do your research on BCG protocals from Dr. Lamm and discuss it with your doc.

He found it the day before I took off on business for a 3 week trip out of the country.  We did schedule the TUR for the day after I returned, so it's been pretty quick to get things done so far.

Gemcitabine may be more active than mitomycin C with a lower toxicity profile. Compared to intravesical BCG therapy, gemcitabine had similar effects in intermediate risk patients, less effective in high risk patient and superior in BCG refractory patients. However, each randomised trial identified represents a different clinical setting in NMIBC and therefore the evidence base is limited. Consequently these data should be interpreted with caution until further corroborative evidence becomes available. The aim of intravesical therapy in NMIBC is to prevent tumour recurrence and progression and to avoid the morbidity associated with cystectomy. Intravesical gemcitabine is a promising drug that may add to the urologist's options in achieving this goal.\"\n\nIf you Google \"intravesicle gemcitabine\" you will find lots of good information on studies.

Use KY liberally on the tube where it enters the body.  I think it is like a minimum of four times a night while sleeping that the average male gets an erection.

I learned, thankfully, that without that prostate catheterizing is a piece of cake.

Pushing a scope through that point can be pretty bad for some but for MOST it is better categorized as discomfort.  Usually, once past that point, it is not painful.\n\nIf you experience pain, make sure to tell the doctor and ask about something to make it better.  The numbing gel should be left in for 10 minutes before the actual procedure if it's going to do much good.

I failed BCG after a couple of doses anyway so I guess it didn't matter much in my case.\n\n\nHere is one study on it:\n\n\n\tBCG and Statins\n Starts at the bottom of page 2705 (1st page).  This is from 2006.  It is not clear if taking statins prior (but going off during treatment) was looked at all.  So, based on information in this study it might not make a difference even if you went off during BCG since you've been taking it.  My personal (not medical) opinion is that it would need a group that didn't take statins, a group that took statins but stopped prior to starting BCG, and group that took statins and stayed on them through BCG treatments in order to be relevant.  I would think it would be beneficial to even further stratify the statin users by the amount of statins they use.  Is 20mg ok but 60mg not ok?  That type of thing.  That's not medicine, that's just basic scientific theory that they teach in fourth grade.

Also worth asking your urologist.\n\nEven with studies like these, you can't tell who may have sponsored it.  For example, did a non-statin drug maker for lowering cholestoral fund the first study and statin maker fund the second?  Were they purely done for research purposes by the doctors without being specifically funded by someone?   That's why I'd ask the doctor for sure in this case.\n\nNow if there were 40 or 50 studies and they all seemed to come up with similar results....STILL ask the doctor. \n\nYou don't want to just stop taking something without the doctor knowing and it may not even be worth the risk.\n\nIn your case, since you just started and it's a low dose, the doctors (Lamm and yours) may have some ideas about your particular situation.\n\nMike\t\t\t", "date": "2010-08-30T16:37:46+00:00", "topic": "Statins and BCG", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tAshish\n\nHe should certainly talk to his doctor and probably get another culture.

If that's the only side effects you are having so far, that it good news.\n\n\n\tWeb Cafe BCG link\n\n\nThis link is also helpful.  It's \n\tDr. Lamm's website\n\n\nI know what you meant and at first thought it was just a typo but when I saw it the second time, I thought it might be worth mentioning that you mean TURB or TURBT.  TransUrethral Resection of Bladder Tumor.  A TURP is TransUrethral resection of the Prostate.  I know since I've had both.  \n\nGood luck with the BCG treatments and I'm glad you found our site.\n\nMike\t\t\t", "date": "2010-07-17T13:28:19+00:00", "topic": "BCG Question", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tKen,\n\nHave a great time with your granddaughter!\n\nI hope you never have to make that decision....but if you do, you will be ready and be well armed with lots of information.\nI found it better to ready way ahead of time.

Clearly, I hope you never have to have an RC, but as someone who has, there is nothing I can't do that I could do before.\n\nI hope that the BCG continues to work well for you and the bladder cancer is a thing of the past for you.\n\n\nMike\t\t\t", "date": "2010-07-16T03:01:53+00:00", "topic": "BCG ongoing", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tJim,\n\nOne thing that is just a good idea in general is to sit down and do up a list of all the surgeries you've ever had, any alergies or strange reactions to any medications, any medications that you take regularly as well as any vitamins or other suppliments.  Everybody always wants to know all of those things and if you have it all typed up and printed out, it makes it easier to fill out their forms.\n\nOther than listing the hernia surgery and TURP, I don't think you'd need any more record than that with regard to those.\n\nYour uro will have a copy of the reports from the pathologist but you need to get the actual slides.\n\nIf you don't know how to get in touch with the pathologist to get the slides, your urologist will know and can tell you.\n\nAn annual physical is always a good idea but it's not a requirement for getting the second opinion.  If there are other medical conditions that you are concerned about however, you should probably try to get a physical.  If for nothing else, to put your mind at ease.  I'm guessing there is a slight concern there which is why you asked the question.\n\nFrom your urologist, you also want a CD with any scans or xrays that they had done.  If the urologist doesn't have them they will tell you how to get them.  Usually, you just call the hospital where you had the xrays and/or scans done and tell them you need a CD with everything on it and you just go pick it up.  You have to sign a form that says you give your permission for you to see the reports (HIPPA requirement).\n\nI don't think you're making this more difficult.  I think you are a bit nervous and want to make sure you are doing everything right and covering all the bases.  That's just smart.

Some reactions such as painful or frequent urination can be related to irritation of the bladder. These symptoms typically begin 4 to 6 hours after instillation and last 24-72 hours. They are usually seen after the third treatment and tend to increase in severity after each administration. Other symptoms, such as flu-like symptoms, fever, fatigue, and chills may affect your whole body. These symptoms also may get more frequent or worse with subsequent treatments.\n\n>Report Side Effects\nNotify your doctor at once if you experience any problems, particularly severe urinary symptoms such as burning or painful urination, an urgent or frequent need to urinate, or blood in the urine. Also report joint pain, coughing, or rash. It is especially important to report these symptoms to your doctor before you receive the next treatment of BCG. They may be a sign that you have an infection requiring immediate attention. You should be aware that infections associated with TICE\u00ae BCG treatment have led to death on rare occasions. Symptoms lasting longer than 48 hours or a fever of 101.3\u00b0F (or higher) should be reported to your physician immediately.\n\nHere is the link to the source of the above information: www.ticebcg.com/Consumer/faqs/index.asp#a72115\n\nAgain, I did the underlining just to highlight where it mentions symptoms that you mentioned.\n\nMike\t\t\t", "date": "2010-06-19T20:51:28+00:00", "topic": "bcg", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tCarol,\n\nYour symptoms sound like the things that your doctor should have told you to call him right away if you got them.\nSIDE EFFECTS: Painful or difficult urination, frequent urination, cramps, pain or blood in the urine may occur 2 to 4 hours after being given this medication and may continue for 24 to 72 hours.

It seems like many people drop out (myself included back in 2006) of BCG treatment due to severe reaction.  Your research and posting seem to indicate that lower dose strength does not have decreased efficacy.  Therefore, it seems like it would make sense to start people on 1% or 5% and then increase if required to get the reaction desired rather than going the other direction of starting high and reducing.\n\nJust wondering if there is some way to test patients (maybe not researched yet?) for thier individual sensitivity to BCG so that urologists could set the dose to the patient and not just by personal preference.  I know some start at 50%, 33%, or full.  Patients react differently so it seems to make sense to find a way to tune to the individual patient.\n\nSeems like less dropouts would mean more lives saved.\nDr. Lamm Response:Yes, Mike.  I quite routinely give percutaneous BCG.  It is not injected, but given by the TINE technique- like a smallpox vaccination.  That does provide some measure of immune response.\nSo folks may want to ask their doctors about this if they are going to start on BCG.\n\nMike\t\t\t", "date": "2010-06-02T17:40:04+00:00", "topic": "I did it again...and survived!", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tOncovite is the one by Dr. Lamm.\n\nIf you're taking it to prevent recurrence, don't pay any attention to the dosage on the bottle.

You are not alone!  While we're sorry you had to join our club, we've been through what you are going through now and are here to help you.\n\n2. Bladder cancer is NOT a death sentence!  Bladder cancer caught at early stages (non-invasive) is very treatable.  Actually, invasive bladder cancer is very treatable as well as long as it is caught before it spreads outside the bladder.  However, it is extremely important that you treat this aggressively.  Do not spend months contemplating options as time is cancer\u2019s friend much more than your friend right now.\n\n3. Treatments for non-invasive bladder cancer are very different from other cancers you have heard about.  Even if your doctor suggests BCG (immunotherapy) or chemotherapy, it is instilled directly into your bladder (not into your blood stream) so it does not cause the hair loss, bone marrow damage, and other side effects that other types of chemotherapy have.\n\n4. Second opinions from major cancer centers that deal specifically with bladder cancer are very important.  You want somebody treating you and/or recommending a treatment plan that deals with bladder cancer every day.  If your doctor has a problem with you getting a second opinion, drop him/her like a rock because it is an indicator that they are not such a good doctor.  It doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t like your doctor, it means you want the highest chance of survival and this is borne out by the statistics.  More experience equals better outcomes.\n\n5. Keep notes. This is a stressful time and your memory of discussions with doctors can be spotty.  Research shows it is very low.  Keep a journal or log book of your visits, your questions, doctor\u2019s answers, your medications, treatments, symptoms, etc.  All of this will help you immensely during your treatment.  A pocket tape recorder is OK also.  Having a loved one accompany you on visits is also a good thing but should not be a substitute for detailed notes.  Get copies of your records from your doctor for every test and every visit.  Read them and ask questions about them and be sure they are accurate.\n\n5 1/2. You are NOT alone!  Search this site in the information area and read the information two or three times.  Take notes when the articles raise questions that you want to ask your doctor.  Search through our Forum section and ask us questions.  There is nothing about bladder cancer that you can ask that is too personal.\n\n\nMike\t\t\t", "date": "2009-07-02T14:43:20+00:00", "topic": "5 things I wish I knew at dx?", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tBritt,\n\nI must have missed the posts about the cytologies.  The fact that you have had two and they were both \"ALL CLEAR\" is a GREAT SIGN! \n\nAs Julie said, you have to prioritize when you have so many different health issues competing for your attention.  I wish the VA was competing for your attention more than they are.  It makes me ashamed that our government lets the VA problem languish on after the service you and others have given our country.\n\nPositive cytologies is a very, very good sign.  I think you could safely let the cysto slide a bit (not forever) and not worry so much about that.  I certainly wouldn't risk my life to get a cysto if I had your other issues and two clean cytology reports.\n\nYou mentioned previously about your friend's in high places that could pull strings in the VA.  I'd go back to them again if I were you in addition to your congressional representatives.\n\nAlso, as Cynthia already mentioned, discussing other health issues is just fine here and she'd never restrict anyone for that.  That video however, was gross (and not bladder cancer related) and I also didn't think it belonged here.\n\nThat's completely different than explaining all of the other medical issues you have and medications that you're on.

Dietary factors such as increased fat and animal protein, especially when broiled, can promote development of cancer, but many foods such as soy, garlic, cruciferous vegetables, fruits, tea, and even some chocolates have beneficial ingredients such as antioxidants that may reduce the risk of cancer. With a healthy diet and life style, which includes regular exercise and avoidance of carcinogens including tobacco, supplemental vitamins may not be needed. Many of us, however, may benefit from supplemental vitamins. Here's how they work:\n\nVitamin A, important for cell differentiation, has been shown to inhibit development of bladder cancer in animal studies and some epidemiologic studies have suggest that increased Vitamin A intake lowers the risk of developing bladder cancer. High doses of Vitamin A and the related derivative Etretinate have had some success in the treatment and prevention of bladder cancer.\n\nVitamin B6 stimulates the immune system and alters the breakdown of the amino acid tryptophane to reduce chemicals that have been implicated in the development of bladder cancer. A Veteran's Administration study found that Vitamin B6 reduced bladder tumor recurrence, but subsequent trials were unsuccessful.\n\nVitamin C also stimulates the immune system and is an important antioxidant that blocks many carcinogens. Epidemiologic studies suggest increased Vitamin C intake reduces risk of bladder cancer. Animal studies are inconsistent, but Vitamin C can prevent and even reverse malignant transformation of cells cultured in the laboratory.\n\nVitamin E, also an antioxidant and immune stimulant, is associated with a reduced risk of cancer. Animal studies show a 30 to 60% reduction in cancer with Vitamin E administration.\n\nOther vitamins including folic acid and Vitamin D also appear to reduce the risk of cancer. In a randomized comparison of standard multiple vitamins versus high doses of vitamins A, B6, C, E and zinc in patients with bladder cancer treated with BCG we found a statistically significant 40% reduction in bladder tumor recurrence. Since that time additional vitamins have been reported to reduce cancer growth, and these have been added to the preparation. The dose for bladder cancer patients is two tablets twice a day, reduced to a total of three tablets a day for those under 100 lbs.\n\nWhile vitamins are generally recognized as safe, side effects can occur with high doses. Because of the high dose of vitamin A, Oncovite should be strictly avoided in anyone who might become pregnant. Vitamin A can also cause liver malfunction, and tests of liver function should be done yearly. Because of the maximal doses of several vitamins, other vitamins should not be taken with Oncovite.\n\nThe benefit of high dose vitamins is currently being evaluated again in patients receiving optimal BCG maintenance therapy with or without interferon alfa.\n\n(See website for ingredients of Oncovite and graph related to recurrence rate).\n\nMike\t\t\t", "date": "2009-04-10T12:27:31+00:00", "topic": "Questions on BCG vs Mitomycin and Oncovite", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tThe Mitomycin is supposed to be easier on your system than the BCG.  They tried me on it after I failed BCG.  I wound up failing that also though.\n\nI bought the Oncovite but I found out later I was taking the wrong doseage.  I took the doseage indicated on the bottle, which is one pill a day.\n\nDr. Lamm's doseage for recurrence prevention is two pills a day (I think).  Double check.\n\nMy cancer came back in any case but I suspected it would since I didn't do well on BCG or Mitomycin.

It is not the end of the world although it is certainly scary as all get out when the surgery is in front of you.

Sloan is one of the best in the country so you are at the right place.\n\nYou want nerve sparing surgery when they take the prostate. Very important for ongoing functioning.  You could require pills or shots for a while before that gets back to normal.\n\nThere are different options in terms of bladder replacement.  I have a neobladder.  That is where they remove a segment of your own small intestine, form it into a pouch and then hook it up to your original plumbing.\n\nA bunch of us have neobladders, some have Indiana pouch, same thing except they hook it up to a stoma hidden inside your belly button.  Ileal conduit is where you don't have any internal storage and they route your ureters to a stoma on your side and you have an external bag for urine collection.\n\nAs you likely already know but probably need to hear again is that bladder cancer is very treatable. Even when it has become muscle invasive.\n\nIf you want to talk, send your contact info through the \"contact us\" function and I will get in touch with you.

I know there is nothing in the NCCN guidelines with regard to IMRT and it is always tough when trying to deal with insurance companies over anything.\n\nPET scans are fairly common and I had one after my first recurrence of bladder cancer because the idea is to see if it has spread.  So...if the PET scan gets ordered in order to rule out the spread of the bladder cancer, it seems like it should be covered.  I was on BCBS when I had my PET scan and it was never an issue.  Didn't even require preapproval unless it was done behind the scenes without my knowing about it.\n\nI hadn't even heard of IMRT (or may have in passing) but it doesn't look like it has been used much for bladder cancer from any sites on IMRT that I found.  One site said: The areas most commonly treated with IMRT are: prostate, spine, lung, breast, kidney, pancreas, liver, larynx, tongue and sinus. The brain is treated with IMRT when one-session radiosurgery is not appropriate or unavailable.\n\nAlso, most sites I read said that insurance often does not cover it.  No idea how much it costs. Best of luck with getting them to reconsider.\n\nBladder cancer has one of the highest recurrence rates of all cancers.  That works against you when trying to argue for a treatment that is only going to address this specific tumor because if it is muscle invasive the risk of metastasis is high.  The recurrence rate is high enough that insurance may say, even if you get the tumor, it is just going to come back and if you can't remove the bladder it is going to be radiation after radiation until it spreads. Not letting her get the PET scan doesn't seem to make sense unless the radiologist is asking for only a pelvic CT/PET. If they as for a full body PET scan, that is looking for any remote spread (metastasis).\n\nWhat stage did they say the cancer is? The first level of muscle invasive is T2. T4 is that it has already gone all the way through the muscle to outside of the bladder.\n\nSorry I can't offer more information.  I've been working (to use a polite term) with my insurance company for three months already on trying to figure out why they decided after 15 years that my 60mg of simvastatin is now no longer a safe dose.  So far, I am not winning that fight even though I gave them the FDA study that says even 80mg is safe if one has been on it for over a year without muscle damage.

Seems to me like overall it sucks!\nI really hope it all works out.\n\nOne thought is that because it was T3, then the rest of the bladder is HIGHLY likely to have a recurrence.  If they got the only two lymph nodes that had cancer spread then wouldn't removing the source improve the odds?\n\nIf you haven't asked them about the CT/PET (the PET part being the operative word) then you may want to discuss it. They do head to toe and put radioactive stuff in the veins.  If you do it and you get the CD of the scan don't freak out when your kidneys, brain, and bladder light up like New Your City at night.  It doesn't mean anything.  Freaked me out but that's what I get for looking at scans without waiting for the doctor to do the report.\n\nSounds like you are in good hands so that is good.

Jim had lymph node spread and went through chem and he's doing fine.  \"Jimswife\" posts here and hopefully she will see your message and chime in.\n\n\nI have no clue why they would be thinking \"wait and see\" is an appropriate response.

Then, I'm not so sure removal is absolute at that point.  Not because it would be \"cured\" by the chemo, but because it might not really be worth it at that point.  A lot depends on how effective the chemo is and if there are any signs of metastasis. If there are mets or if the chemo isn't effective \"enough\" (in the judgement of her docs), then why go through all of the surgery.  However, things could go very well and it could make sense to do the cystectomy.\n\nThe tricky part of \"Prepare for the worst, hope for the best, and be happy to get something in between\" is, for cases like this, figuring out what the best and worst are because there are so many variables.\n\nThere is risk to the surgery and being older (and I recall you using he word \"frail\" before) makes it even harder.  Being prepared for and dealing with an ileal conduit or Indiana Pouch diversion may or may not be really difficult.\n\nSorry to be talking in circles.  The reason they would take the bladder out after the chemo is that if the bladder is still there, the cancer is going to come back.

I'm not really one of those folks.  My guess is that at 84, there are other health issues and going through a surgery like this would either be too risky or generally pointless.\n\nIf it is already spread locally, then chemo is already in order and getting an RC just makes life more complicated.  If the doc thinks it isn't really going to extend his life anyway, then someone needs to discuss why he's even on chemo then.  The doctor should be able to walk you (and him) through the pros and cons of doing the chemo and what the tradeoffs are.\n\nYour dad may have to sign a release for the doctor to speak with you about it but you should get involved.  Get the doctor's sense of the timing (general prognosis), how to know when he's moving from one phase to another and what to expect. At some point, palliative care is going to be the main thing.  That is, pain management.  Another thing to look into, depending on the prognosis, is hospice care.  They are experts.\n\nSorry if my response seems clinical.

I think all of us who have had the surgery know what you mean about mixed emotions.  It is a VERY tough surgery to recover from.\n\nYou will not want to walk at all.  You will want to just stay in bed and push the pain medicine pump.  HOWEVER, you must get up and walk.  It is the thing that gets you better fastest.  Also, chew gum after surgery but don't swallow it.  Both of these things wake the intestines up and that is critical to recovery.  Have someone come to the hospital to help you walk and to make you walk.  Even walking in place next to the bed is a good start.  The day after surgery you need to be up.\n\nAfter that, at least 3 times a day and then 6 times a day after a couple of days.  That's at least!  Your doctor should explain it to you.  Ask him about it.  Also, a key is the surgical nursing staff.  Be nice to those people.  You want and need their help.\n\nThe couple days after surgery are going to feel like a Mack truck hit you and then backed over you and did it again.  Walking, even though it will feel like you do not have any energy to do so will do wonders.  The longer you delay walking, the longer it will take for you to recover enough to get out of the hospital.\n\nBest of luck!

Sorry you had to be here.\n\nMy case is a bit different.  I have the neobladder (Oct 2008) and had some complications.\n\nEveryone is different so don't assume you'd have the same result.  Get the best darn surgeon you can find.  They should perform AT LEAST 50 a year.  Get to the best hospital you can with the best nursing staff with experience treating bladder cancer patients.\n\nI do have to catheterize.  I didn't at first but my neobladder got overstretched so I couldn't really empty it.  I can squeeze and push and get some out but I can't get empty so I'd have to go every couple hours.  Instead, I choose (yes, as weird as that sounds, I choose) to catheterize every time I go.  This way I go about once every four hours or so and I get completely empty.\n\nThe whole catheter thing is WAY scarier thinking about it than it is doing it.  I was scared to death of that and did NOT want to have to catheterize.  Ask me if I think it's a big deal now.  Go ahead, ask me.  OK, if you insist, I will tell you.  It's no big deal.  I mean really, really, really no big deal at all.\n\nThe reason it would hurt when getting a catheter for BCG or getting a cystoscopy was the prostate.  They take that sucker out when they take the bladder.  So, after getting that out, it is a piece of cake.  I'll bet you fifty bucks I could do my own cystoscopy now if they'd let me.\n\nMy doctor says, \"Why don't you try to get as much out as you can without it and then just use the catheter a couple times a day?\"  My response is \"Why do I want to waste five minutes scrunching and squeezing and rutching around trying to get the urine out if I can just use that 16 French catheter and be empty of 800 cc of urine in seconds?  If I dropped my catheter or something, then I'd do that but otherwise, what is the point?\n\nHopefully, you won't have any complications and you won't have to catheterize.  If you do though, it is not a big deal without a prostate.  Quite honestly, I had so darn many problems with my prostate before this surgery I was happy to get it out.  Not quite as happy as getting rid of the cancer of the bladder, but it was a source of frustration for years.  I used to have to get up at night about every hour to hour and half.  I used to have leave business meetings repeatedly to go to the bathroom.  No more!  I can outlast the best of them.  I use the stall instead of the urinal but again, no big deal.\n\nI don't leak at all during the day.  I do leak at night so I have taken to wearing condom catheters.  I put it on, hook it up to a bag and go to sleep.  I don't get up in the night for anything.  I get the best sleep I've had in years.  This part is a bit of a pain because I have to be sure I'm good and empty if I fall asleep on a plane or something.  I can go for an hour or so without leaking so a Sunday nap is OK as long as I empty before the nap.\n\nI do not recommend the condom catheter to anyone recovering from surgery during the training period.  The only time you want to use something like that is if you've given up on night time continence.  90+% or so of men with neobladders get night time continence.  I am in the minority.\n\nWould I do it again?  Yes.  If I knew with absolute certainty that I wasn't going to get night time continence and I'd have to catheterize every time I went, I'd still probably try for the neo.\n\nGood luck on your surgery!  I hope I didn't scare you.  My point is really that, to me, it is not a bid deal.  I am one happy camper and I am not going to die from bladder cancer.  I'm over three years cancer free now and plan on staying that way.\n\nMike\t\t\t", "date": "2012-02-18T00:06:00+00:00", "topic": "Anyone have experience with the Ileal Neobladder?", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tCongrats Herb!

A TURBT is a TransUrethral Removal of a Bladder Tumor.\n\nI can't do anything for your mistrust of doctors, but I will say it highly unlikely that they are out to get you or have plans to try to take advantage of you just because you don't know all the medical details.  You may have had some crappy ones but most are not.\n\nThe prostate comes out because it is extremely likely that bladder cancer will spread to the prostate.  They do nerve sparing now to try to maintain erectile function.\n\nThey can't just keep taking it out (the tumors) once they reach a certain stage.  Once into the muscle it will spread throughout the body in a process called metastasis.  If one waits too long to get the bladder removed once it becomes muscle invasive, the chances of metastatic disease are greatly increased (as is likelihood of dying from bladder cancer).  It's not like the tumors are just benign moles or something--they are cancer.\n\nProstate tumors that are prostate cancer are different than bladder cancer that has spread to the prostate.\n\nTreatment is certainly the choice of the individual.  More aggressive treatment leads to higher life expectancy.  The inverse is also true.\n\nTrouble urinating is most likely the prostate causing the problem.  However, that is really not very high on the priority list given you have bladder cancer to deal with.  You really don't have a lot of time to mull this over.  You need to get to a top bladder cancer hospital right now and get something done.

In a systematic review comparing cytology with a number of bladder tumor markers (including NMP-22) (Lotan & Roehrborn, 2003), the specificity of urine cytology was 99%. Unfortunately, its sensitivity was far lower, varying from 30% to 50% in invasive bladder tumors and 20% to 30% in superficial malignancies. The relatively low sensitivity of cytology makes it inadequate as a screening modality. However, urine cytology is often used in combination with urethrocystoscopy to detect bladder cancers in persons deemed to be at high risk, particularly when urinalysis reveals clinically relevant hematuria.\nConclusion\n\nWhile the preponderance of evidence reveals that NMP-22 is more sensitive than either urinalysis or voided urine cytology for detecting low-stage bladder cancers, it lacks adequate sensitivity to replace urethrocystoscopy for diagnosing bladder cancer (see Table 2 ). Data from a meta-analysis comparing voided urine cytology and NMP-22 supports the use of this (or the BTA STAT assay) over urine cytology because of its increased sensitivity in detecting low-stage and low-grade recurrences, but the authors also note that its role is limited to adjunctive to urethrocystoscopy. Until the sensitivity of the NMP-22 is improved, or another urine assay emerges that provides significantly greater sensitivity while maintaining adequate specificity, urethrocystoscopy will remain the reference test for detecting and diagnosing bladder and its recurrence.\nWith that said, when I had my recurrence (two years after initial diagnosis and treatment) it was the NMP22 test that showed something was there when the doctor couldn't see anything with the scope.  So, it seems like having both done on a regular basis after initial diagnosis (every three months) is prudent and is considered the standard of care in the NCCN bladder cancer treatment guidelines.\n\nMike\t\t\t", "date": "2011-11-18T04:19:36+00:00", "topic": "Test for cancer cells in urine", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tI'd go wherever Pat says to go.  \nSeriously!\n\nMike\t\t\t", "date": "2011-10-06T01:21:32+00:00", "topic": "Need help finding doctor in SE US", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tConsider one of the those abdominal binders for when you are exercising.

There are quite a few of us that have had cystectomies here.  If you are at stage III, they will likely want to do chemo either before or after the cystectomy.\n\nStage 2 is invaded the muscle wall.  Stage 3 is through the muscle wall into outer fat layer.  Here is a really good site for explanation of stage/grade \n\tStage and Grade\n\n\nGet yourself to a top doc as fast as possible.  MSK is one of the best in your area.  Pat will hopefully be online soon.  She is the best one with keeping track of the top surgeons in the country.  She can give names.  You asked the right question because having one of the top docs that does these surgeries like an assembly line is one of the most important factors in the best outcomes.  Stage 3 is clearly not something to mess around with, as I'm sure you've already figured out.  You NEED a top doc!!!\n\nThe surgery is hard.  If you get a neobladder (that's what I have) it's about 6-7 hours.  It's major, major surgery.  Average is to be out of the hospital in 6-7 days.  I had complications and was in for 12 days.  Some get out in 5 days.  It all depends on the skill of the surgeon and the speed that your intestines wake back up.\n\nAsk about epidural.  Morphine and other pain meds given make it take longer for the intestines to wake up. Some people are more sensitive than others in that regard.\n\nAfter surgery, walk!  Have somebody come make you walk because you won't want to and you won't think you are ready to.  Walking in place next to your bed is probably the best you will be able to do the day after surgery.  Walking helps wake up the intestines, is good for the circulation, etc.  At least three times a day starting the day after.  Day 2, get out into the hall and by day 3 be walking up and down the halls as much as you can but at least three times a day.\n\nErectile dysfunction is kind of the least of your worries right now but they can do nerve sparing surgery when they take the prostate.  You do want that.  That's also the reason to get top surgeon.  With nerve sparing, erections often come back.  Takes anywhere from a month or so to a couple years.  It varies.  There are things (pump, pills, shots) that you can use in the interim until things get back to normal.  If they don't get back to normal there are other things that can be done for long term.  First priority though is to get rid of the cancer and not be dead.  Dead guys tend to not have very good erections so first, focus on not being dead.  Then erections.  \n\nI don't mean to be flippant about the subject but in a few years (I'm 3 years past my RC in a few days) you will also realize why I put the first priority where I did.\n\nIt can take up to 6 months to be \"fully\" recovered.  This really takes a lot out of you.  I was back to work a couple of weeks after getting out of the hospital but I'm a consultant and can work (and did at the time) work from home.  At first, just a few hours or so a day and then built back up for full time plus.  It was a month and half before I was flying to clients again and one needs to be very careful with that because of lifting things.  Should NOT lift anything over you head for a while after surgery.  I got LOTS of incisional hernias that required follow up repair by a general surgeon.  I just always seemed to think I could do more than I should have been.\n\nThere is an urgency but there is time to get to the right surgeon.  At stage 3, I'm guessing you will be expedited through the process.  First TURB is often under-staged.  I hope that is not the case for you but you do need to be aware of that.\n\nDid you mean \"young life\" or \"young wife\"?  Not sure what you meant there.\n\nMore will chime in soon I'm sure.  Ask any specific questions you want.  We're here to help and to share what we went through and what we know.  Don't want to bombard you with too much at once though.  Tell us what you need and we'll work with you a step at a time.\n\nMike\t\t\t", "date": "2011-10-05T20:43:59+00:00", "topic": "Radical Cystectomy--experiences &amp;amp; good doctors DC?", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tBactrim DS working well.

It has bigger holes and a larger diameter so mucous can pass and so you don't spend 10 minutes doing it.  I found a 14 to be just too small for me.

However, I can't find any of the articles that I read.  The link above is a presentation.  When I went in for that repair, I didn't have bowel prep. I did have bowel prep prior to my neo. If Pat says the jury is still out then I believe her.  I don't do as much research and I trust her her research.\n\nI did have NG tube at the NCI hospital after the RC and I had it again at a non-NCI hospital after my bowel repair.\n\nIn both cases, they turned off vaccuum to see if things would work.  When they didn't the vaccuum would get turned back on.  For my RC, the NG tube was removed too soon and had to be put back in two different times.  First, they got it down my lung and needed to pull back to get it into my stomach.  Then, after having delusions from phergan a few days later, I ripped out all my tubes, including the NG tube.  That time it went back in easier but it is still not fun.\n\nI don't really care about what articles may say for the NG tube issue.  If people don't mind having a tube shoved up their nose and having to swallow and swallow and swallow to try to get into their stomach, then more power to them.  If I EVER wake up with an NG tube still in, I'm not getting it out until I am DAMN SURE it doesn't need to go back in again.  On this, I speak only for myself.  As always, everyone should discuss the details with their doctors and do their own research.\n\nArthur: Always ask the doctor yourself.

You mentioned a few weeks back or so that you were waiting and that you were starting the chemo.\n\nHad it spread to urethra?  Is it confirmed T2?  Since they wanted to do chemo it must have been T2 for a while.\n\nA while back I gave you some things to ask and things to do in preparation for the surgery.  I can certainly understand with everything going on if you haven't had the chance to do the kegel exercises.  If not, you may want to start now.  It's what will strengthen your pelvic floor muscles and that is what is needed to get continence more quickly after the surgery.\n\nSince your other update was kind of in the middle of someone else's thread, I came back here to your thread.  Feel free to open a new one as well whenever you move into a new chapter of this book called Life with Bladder Cancer.  Of course after the surgery, it will be a whole new book called Life after Bladder Cancer!  \n\nOne of the keys to getting out of the hospital sooner (and being ready to get out) is that your intestines have to wake back up.  I mentioned this previously but now that you are getting close to the surgery date, you may want to follow up with your surgeon.\n\nHere are some questions:\n1. Do I have to do bowel prep prior to the surgery?\nIf no, then good.  If he says yes, then ask why since studies have shown reduced post op ileus complications when not doing bowel prep. The prep involves mag nitrate and pooping your insides out prior to the surgery.  Try to get out of this!\n\n2. Can this be done with an epidural to reduce post op ileus chances?  Depending on your situation, he may have good reason not to.  People who have epidural seem to have quicker recovery so it is worth checking into.\n\n3. Are you going to put in a suprapubic tube?\nNot all do.  Mine didn't but it sure sounds like it was a good thing for people who did get it.  He can explain what it is if you don't know or you can google it.\n\nAfter the surgery, as soon as possible, walk.  You want to walk starting the next day at the latest.  Morning, noon, and evening.  You will not want to.  Get someone to make you.  If you wait until you feel like walking you will be inviting problems and it will interfere with your recovery.  Even if you start off just walking in place or in the room.  Have someone with you in case you aren't steady on your feet but they can get a nurse to walk with you if someone is not around at all the times you need to walk.\n\nIf all goes just wonderfully, you can expect to get out of the hospital anywhere from 5-8 days.  If you get a post-op ileus that lasts a long time, it can take longer.  I was  in for 12 days.  I can tell you the ileus issues can be really bad so that's why I give so much info about trying to avoid them.\n\nAlso, same day as surgery, chew gum.  You will have a nasal gastric (NG) tube in.  The chewing helps trigger responses in the body that have been shown to help wake the intestines.\nRegarding the NG tube, even though it's a nuisance, DO NOT get it removed until you are ready.  You DO NOT want them putting that sucker back in while you are awake!!!  Just trust me on that one.  You are ready when your intestines are working and you are able to take liquids without throwing up. They usually wait until you have bowel sounds before letting you have liquid.\n\nI hope all goes well with your surgery and you are out of the hospital and on the road to recovery in a very short amount of time.\n\nMike\t\t\t", "date": "2010-03-23T22:18:50+00:00", "topic": "Newly diagnosed Invasive..Need Support", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tWell even I can dial a phone on the weekend but I can't do surgery so I'm not sure that calling on the weekend has much to do with his skill as a surgeon.  Still, I guess it is what it is.\nIf you do require a repair at some point, I would suggest that you consider finding the top surgeon you can find.  If it's just fixing a leak (it could probably be done by a general surgeon.\n\nI've not heard anyone else having a JP drain in three months after surgery but it certainly doesn't mean that it has never happened before.  Just hasn't happened to people who come to this site over the past four years that I've been around.\n\nAlso, if you do get it fixed, it would seem like you could have something like that done laparoscopically (sometimes called keyhole surgery).  Tiny incisions make for faster recovery.  They can even do it with an epidural.\n\nSure hope it gets resolved soon!\nMike\t\t\t", "date": "2010-06-14T01:49:36+00:00", "topic": "3 months in with neo bladder and still leaing", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tYes, further up in the thread, Cynthia mentioned that this landed here by mistake from the blog section.

Transitional cell cancers start in the cells lining the bladder. If the cancer stays in this layer of cells, without growing into the deeper layers, it is called noninvasive. If the cancer grows beneath the top layer, into the lamina propria or even deeper into the muscle layer, it is called invasive. Invasive cancers are more likely to spread and are harder to treat. You may also see a bladder cancer described as superficial or non-muscle invasive. The term includes both noninvasive tumors as well as any invasive tumors that have not grown into the main muscle layer of the bladder \n\nAs you can see from the quote, it is clear that there are different ways the terms are used.  One being to specificy if it is muscle invasive or not and the other being anything beyond the topmost layer.\n\neMedicine agrees with me:\nBladder cancers are classified (staged) by how deeply they invade into the bladder wall, which has several layers. Many physicians subdivide bladder cancer into superficial and invasive disease. Superficial bladder cancer is limited to the innermost linings of the bladder (known as the mucosa and lamina propria). Invasive bladder cancer has at least penetrated the muscular layer of the bladder wall.\nIt is a very good point that you raise though as doctor's and different web sites also refer to it differently. Some are very specific about only referring to \"non-muscle-invasive\" or \"muscle invasive\". People should be specific when speaking with their urologists to understand the exact stage beyond using the word invasive.\n\nMike\t\t\t", "date": "2010-06-14T01:41:33+00:00", "topic": "Invasive Bladder Cancer", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tThanks everyone.

I suppose that it a guess on my part as last time I partook of the morphine to keep the pain away and this time I opted against that.\n\nA year ago or so I would have thought someone crazy if they turned down pain meds.

If it clogs, it can prevent any urine from coming out and cause stretching (and over-stretching) of the pouch.  This is NOT a good thing.  You can also have urine backing up into the kidneys and in at least one case I know of personally can get to the point of life threatening.\n\nIf you ever have to go into the hospital and will be getting a catheter for surgery it is critical that the doctors and nurses be made aware of the diversion you have and what to do.\n\nIn my case, by the time I discovered there was nothing in the catheter bag after my surgery, I had already retained over 1000cc of urine in my neobladder.  I told the nurses to pull the foley and I did a straight cath myself.  If you never have had to catheterize, that's ok because you still shouldn't have to.  Tell the nurses they need to do a straight cath and suggest a 16 French.  The 14 French has much smaller holes so the probability of it letting the mucous flow through it is reduced.\n\nWhenever you get surgery, they are filling you full of fluids through the IV so you should have pretty good output and the nurses MUST monitor this closely.  Keep on top of it yourself and ask the nurses about the output.  If you are going to \"out of it\" for a while due to the nature of the surgery, then have somebody come with you who can be an advocate for you and keep an eye on the catheter bag.  If output is low, they should do a straight cath.\n\nYou would be surprised how often this comes up as a problem and it is something that every RC with continent diversion patient should be told about so they can be on lookout and take the necessary precautions.\n\nMike\t\t\t", "date": "2010-01-20T21:53:05+00:00", "topic": "Neobladder, Indiana Pouch and foley catheter", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tI did quit wearing the bracelet but I do still carry the card.\n\nPat's idea sounds good.\n\nMy plan is to always make a point of explaining in detail so I can see the comprehension on their faces for myself.

Since the neo is made with Intenstinal tissue, it absorbs some of its contents back into the bloodstream so basically, the kidneys filter out stuff, send to the neo and then end up re-filtering the same stuff. Therefore, part of the answer is to empty more often then I had been.\nThanks for posting that!  It makes me think I am doing the right thing by cathing all the time.  I've got a neobladder but I was not emptying well and was having about 400cc of \"residual\" after emtpying, which caused my neo to stretch to around 800+cc.  My uro said I should cath daily but I've pretty much been cathing every time I need to empty.  Using a 16French, I can get completely empty in a very short time.\n\nIf I was to try to empty without catheterizing, it would take 5-10 minutes and I'd still wind up with about 200cc of residual so I just figured why mess with trying if I can cath and be in and out of the restroom in a couple of minutes.\n\nSounds like it is a good thing to do for the reason you mention about absorption in addition to being a precaution against over stretching my neo.  I think I've actually reduced the size of the neo a bit by doing this also but I have to do some more monitoring of that when I'm home to confirm.\n\nMike\t\t\t", "date": "2009-09-07T14:04:19+00:00", "topic": "Creatinine Level After RC", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tI hope all went well and everything comes up clean!\n\nMike\t\t\t", "date": "2009-09-29T18:02:02+00:00", "topic": "Bone scan", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tGreat news!

Moved my father in law in to our house a few weeks back and had to manage a contractor to get my walk out basement finished into a suitable place and convert a ground floor study into a hospital room with handicap accessible shower (for when mother in law gets discharged from the rehab facility). Also having to deal with my son's situation where his wife has decided on a divorce. My wife is having back surgery next week to fuse 3 vertibrae and needed to line up someone to come take care of her during her recovery. Besides that and work, not much going on..... \n\nMike\t\t\t", "date": "2009-08-18T15:48:40+00:00", "topic": "Where is everyone?", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tGreat post Cynthia!\t\t\t", "date": "2009-08-09T20:17:39+00:00", "topic": "As time goes by", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tGood deal.

The reason for that is that when I was diagnosed with \"invasive\" (meaning the cancer has gone through the protective inner lining and spread into the muscle of the bladder), it was return of cancer for me.  I origingally had non-invasive.  Because I knew there was a chance that my bladder cancer would come back, I did a lot of research in order to be prepared for whatever action I needed to take.\n\nMy list is more about men, given that's my personal experience,  but some parts pertain to both.\n\n1.  Radical Cystectomy is the Gold Standard of treatment for muscle invasive bladder cancer.  It gives you the highest chance of survival over other treatments for muscle invasive (stage 2 and stage 3) bladder cancer.  While you may think that losing your bladder is a terrible thing, those of us who have had the surgery are here to assure you that it not such a bad thing.  If the cancer is in the muscle of the bladder, you want it out as soon as possible.  The sooner it is out, the higher the probability that the cancer will be gone for good.\n\n2. There are three primary types of diversion techniques. Neobladder is when a segment of your intestine is used to make a new bladder that is hooked up to your original plumbing.  This is closest thing to what you have now.  Indiana pouch is when a segment of your intestine is used to make a new bladder but a pathway is made through your navel (hidden) or a bit off to the side and you use a tube (catheter) to drain it.  The third alternative is an ileal conduit where no pouch is created and your ureters are connected to small segment of intestine that is used to create a stoma that you connect an external bag.  Research the options to make your preference but given what the doctor finds, you may not really have a choice once surgery is underway.  Give your doctor your first, second, and third preference but be prepared.  The good news is that a very high majority of people are very happy with the diversion they have.  There are pros and cons to each.\n\n3. Men will have their prostate removed at the same time as the bladder because there is an extremely high probability of cancer cells getting to the prostate from the bladder.  There is a nerve sparing technique that can be done (ask for it) that improves the chance of regaining erectile function.  Regaining function can take from six months to three years, so you may want to plan activities prior to the surgery with the knowledge that it will be awhile after the surgery.\n\n4. After the surgery, you will have drain tubes and catheters.  You will be on pain meds and you will most likely just want to rest.  Do not succumb to this feeling.  It is imperative that you walk at least twice in the morning, twice more in the afternoon, and twice more in the evening.  Walking is critical to getting your intestines to wake back up start functioning normally again after surgery.  Have a loved one make you walk when you don\u2019t feel it.  The sooner you are walking and the more you are able to do it, the sooner you will get out of the hospital.\n\n5. If you get a neobladder, it takes time to learn how to use it.  Do kegel exercises prior to surgery and after you get out of the hospital.  Search the site for the word \u201ckegel\u201d to learn more about what that is.  You will be using your pelvic floor muscles to empty your neobladder and to gain control.  It takes some time to regain daytime continence (couple of months) and a bit longer for nighttime continence after you get your catheter removed.  Don\u2019t get frustrated, just keep doing the exercises.  When you first get the catheter out, you will have no control.  Use pads, made specifically for men, as they help.  At night, you will want to use the pads in addition to the Depends (or other brands) type underwear for extra absorbency.  There are also external catheters for men that can be used at night.  These are called condom catheters and can be purchased online or specialty pharmacies.\n\nBONUS: If you have had prior problems with enlarged prostate, you are going to find not having the bladder and prostate to be wonderful.  You won\u2019t have to get up as often at night and you won\u2019t have to go so often during the day either.\n\n\"T\" equals Stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCIS \u2013 very early, high grade, cancer cells are detected only in the innermost layer of the bladder lining\nTa \u2013 the cancer is just in the innermost layer of the bladder lining\nT1 \u2013 the cancer has started to grow into the connective tissue beneath the bladder lining\nT2 \u2013 the cancer has grown through the connective tissue into the muscle\nT2a \u2013 the cancer has grown into the superficial muscle\nT2b \u2013 the cancer has grown into the deeper muscle\nT3 \u2013 the cancer has grown through the muscle into the fat layer\nT3a \u2013 the cancer in the fat layer can only be seen under a microscope (microscopic invasion)\nT3b \u2013 the cancer in the fat layer can be seen on tests, or felt by your doctor during an examination under anaesthetic (macroscopic invasion)\nT4 \u2013 the cancer has spread outside the bladder\nT4a \u2013 the cancer has spread to the prostate, womb or vagina\nT4b \u2013 the cancer has spread to the wall of the pelvis or abdomen\n\nFor more information about stage and grade, see: \nwww.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=2703\n\n\nMike\t\t\t", "date": "2009-07-02T14:49:16+00:00", "topic": "5 things I wish I knew (invasive)", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tThat would be roam, wander, mozy, amble....something along that line I believe.   \n\nI speak American, but am fairly fluent in English and Australian.  \nLived in Oz for a couple of years and in India so I picked up a lot of the English language there.

I would have tried to talk my uro into doing an RC even if it returned as non-muscle invasive.  Based on simple logic, if it came back once--it could come back again.  Depending on how aggressive and how often I get checked, it has a chance of coming back and spreading soon after an all clear exam and then having the opportunity to do more damage by my next review.  If I take the bladder in question out of the equation by removing it from my body (and no cells escape during the RC to start up somewhere else in urothelial cells) then I eliminate the possibility of it spreading.\n\nI had checks every three months, had just had a cysto and check and was all clear.

I will put the definition here so others don't have to google it.\nDefinition of Ileum\n\nThe lowest part of the small intestine, located beyond the duodenum and jejunum, just before the large intestine (the colon). Pronounced \"il-eum\" in the US and \"eye-leum\" in the UK.\n\nThe word \"ileum\" is derived from the Greek \"eileos\" meaning \"twisted.\" This is apt because, when the small intestine is viewed at surgery or at autopsy (or exposed from a wound), it looks twisted. It is also apt because, when the small intestine is obstructed, the ileum is most often the site of the twist or whatever is causing the obstruction.\n\nThe small intestine is made up of 3 main parts: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum.\n\nAnatomy of the small intestine: \nThe small bowel is where food is digested and absorbed into the blood. To sustain life, we need around 49 inches (100 cm) of small bowel. The small bowel is the largest hormone producing organ in the body. We ingest thousands of bacteria, viruses, and parasites every day and the small bowel quietly handles these without us knowing. Congenital anomalies, inflammation, obstruction, neoplasia (tumors), perforation, bleeding, and ischemia (lack of oxygen supply) are some of the reasons for small bowel surgery.\n\nAnatomy\n\nThe demarcation between the duodenum (1st part of small bowel) and the jejunum (2nd part of small bowel) is the ligament of Treitz (see Surgery of the Duodenum) (Figure 1)\nThe length of the jejunum is 100 to 110 centimeters in length. It is greater around and has a thicker wall than the ileum\nThe ileum is 150 to 160 centimeters in length\nThe jejunum, ileum, and associated mesenteries (supporting and suspending structures) are attached to the back wall of the abdomen. They are completely covered with peritoneum (single layer of cells that line the surface of the abdomen and bowel)\nThe ileum joins the cecum (first part of the colon) in the right lower quadrant at the ileocecal valve near the appendix (Figure 1). The jejunum and ileum are mobile organs.\nCitation: The above quote is from \nyoursurgery.com/ProcedureDetails.cfm?BR=1&Proc=49\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe terminal ileum is that last part of the ileum where it connects to the large intestine.  The terminal ileum is responsible for processing vitamin B12.\n\nRegards,\nMike\t\t\t", "date": "2009-04-10T07:50:47+00:00", "topic": "Bowel movements", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tBelow is the reply I got from my uro.

That's a lot of tumors.\n\nI will tell you that I am VERY happy with my neobladder.\nBCG to \"slow it down\" does not sound very appealing.  How will they know how often to check back to see if it's invasive and if it's high grade, then how can they be sure that it doesn't go beyond the bladder muscle to outside the bladder before they catch it.\n\nDoesn't seem worth the hassle of every six weeks getting TURBs to me.\n\nWe all have to make our own choices but if I had the reports you posted, I'd have probably opted for the neobladder in December 2008.  The other factor is your concern that other health problems would make you not a candidate in 3 years.\n\nFrankly, that one is a bigger concern with regard to neobladder.  From a caregiver perspective, I believe I've read on this site somewhere that it is easier to take care of an Indiana Pouch or ileal conduit.  The ileal conduit is the easiest, least risky surgery and takes much less time.\nIf you think you may be in a situation where your wife or somebody is going to have catheterize you on a frequent basis, then another option may be a better choice.\n\nI may be over-reacting to that comment you made about 3 years down the road.

I pulled all of mine together and took them with me UCCC (University of Colorado Cancer Center) and MD Anderson.  I also had a zillion different scans and I brought the CDs along with me (in addition to having them all on a flash drive).\n\nI agree that time is of the essence, so I recommend calling to get a rush on the slides (and any scans) and driving over and picking them up.  Also, your uro can probably fax all of their records.\n\nOne thing that I also did was create a detailed report chronologically indicating my entire history.  First symptoms, first diagnosis, each and every test and the result.  The reason I did this is that there is a lot of useless information in some of the reports and I wanted to highlight only things that were related.  Also, I found some of my records had errors in them.  They said I reported blurry vision in the past and I never did and also that I had angina and I never did.  I didn't want incorrect information clouding up the diagnosis.\n\nI suggest keeping all records and creating a summary for the doctors.\n\nGood luck.

I read everything here as well as researching everything I could.  Then, after a few \"all clears\", I dropped off completely.  When it came back, I came back.  Everyone handles things in their own way.  I expect that if I have a few years of \"all clear\" now that I have a neobladder, I will probably drop off again.

I don't want much, do I?  \n\nMy chemo regimen includes the chemo drugs Cisplatin and Gemcitabine and either the placebo or Avastin on day one.  For nausea, Emend for the first three days including day 1.  It also includes Dexamethasone, and Zofran (both twice a day on day 2 through day 4) even if there is no nausea.  This is followed by Zofran for days 5 through 7 only if I have nausea.  Day 8 I get another dose of Gemcitabine and nothing else.  Then day 9 Through 21 I take Zofran as needed.  Then I start all over again.

I doubt any of us can give you the answer you are looking for.  I think only his doctor can make the kind of prognosis you want.\n\nIt's understandable that you'd want him around longer and if chemo works he may be.  Even when longer gets here there will be other things on the horizon that you'd want him to be there for.   Unfortunately (or fortunately, deeding on one's preferences and beliefs) none of know when our time is up exactly.\n\nI'm not surprised he's exhausted.  I had a few intestinal blockages before I finally got a bad kink removed from my intestines and it exhausted me and I was only 51.\n\nAlmost 20 years from initial diagnosis is pretty good  when you think about it.   I know that doesn't really matter right now given the current situation but it may be helpful for people who are just now being diagnosed for the first time when they read this.\n\nI wish him and you the best of outcomes.

Hard to tell if you both have even really come to grips with it yet.  Like you said, your husband may just be coming to terms with it now because you've both been so busy just getting it treated.\n\nAs mentioned, depression is a very real and very challenging possibility.  Do discuss both your husband's and your situation in terms of emotions with the doctor.  Could be something can be prescribed to help during this extremely stressful time.\n\nDon't lose faith.  Try talking with a priest/minister/<insert your spiritual leader here>.  For people who have faith, losing faith during a trying time can compound things even more.\n\nBelief in a higher power, be it God, Gods, the Universe, energy, or what have you can be highly beneficial.  When humans can lay the burden of worry on someone else, it sometimes helps them to let it go enough that they can process their emotions a bit a time instead of being completely overwhelmed.  I'm not talking about laying blame.  I'm talking about saying \"Help, I can't deal with this, please deal with this for me or help me deal with it\".  With that kind of faith the burden is lessened.\n\nIf faith was important to you prior to this, giving up on it now can end up having you feel guilty over that, which basically adds to your burden.\n\nIf your husband can connect to someone who has been through what he is going through it would likely be very helpful for him.  Maybe ask his doctor if there is a prior patient whose been through who would be willing to talk to your husband.\nMaybe someone closer to home would be better for him.  He is not the first person to go through this and he won't be the last.  At the same time, he is likely feeling very isolated.\n\nI am hoping for the best for the both of you.

I can take a nap for about 30 minutes or so if I empty right before but I can't to much more than that.\n\nThere are products out there (vibrating alarms that click to nightwear or that come as watches with vibration enough to wake people) that may help.

(I don't keep it in there to dry out anymore).\n\nWould I be happier if I didn't have to cath?  Sure, who wouldn't.  Is it a big deal?  Nope.  \n\nI don't think they just go in and do the belly button surgery if you have problems that cause you to need to cath.  I would guess it would likely be considered \"elective\" surgery by an insurance company but I don't know that for sure.\n\nMike\t\t\t", "date": "2012-01-06T11:49:21+00:00", "topic": "Neobladder Urione Retention", "subforum": "6-men-and-bladder-cancer"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tLee,\n\nI also wanted to mention, based on your picture you haven't aged a day!\n\nMike    ", "date": "2012-07-06T02:57:59+00:00", "topic": "4 Years and Counting", "subforum": "6-men-and-bladder-cancer"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tOh heck no!!!

Then wait 10 minutes to let it do the job.  Then they use the cystoscope.  The part that ranges from \"ouch\" to \"HOLY CRAP I LEVITATED OFF THE TABLE AND HIT MY FACE ON THE CEILING\" is when the scope goes through the prostatic sphincter.  Usually, after that it is just weird feeling.\n\nThen they give you an antibiotic and send you on your way and there is no problem with urination or any problems.  If you are concerned there might be, ask for some pyridium (phenazopyridine).  It turns your urine bright orange but it is a bladder pain reliever.  If you then have any problem, take as directed.  You can even get them over the counter.\n\nIt is a good thing to be uptight about having things inserted in your penis.

You put them on and hook up to the bag and sleep like a rock through the night with nary a care.  Wake up and dump the bag, wash everything up and toss the condom catheter.\n\nIf I wanted to get up every hour, I could probably set an alarm and cath once per hour but that just has no appeal whatsoever.  Before my surgery, my prostate caused enough issues that I would wake up every hour to 1.5 hours to go.  I kind of like how I feel now that I can actually sleep through the night so I'm not going to try that.  If I was on the road and ran out of them or the bag had a problem or something, I could do the clock thing in an emergency but I'd be a mess long term.\n\nIf you think you are not emptying, you may want to talk to the doc about using a catheter every now and then.  If you haven't used one it is way scarier than it needs to be.  Without the prostate it is simple and easy and that way you know it is empty.

As far as I know that has NOTHING to do with bladder cancer.  If these e coli infections are in your bladder then somebody ought to be able to give you a reason or at least likely reasons.  Do you have well or city water?  A contaminated well can spread e coli. I suppose that could get into the bladder if one soaked in the tub or something.  Contaminated food is also a source but you wouldn't expect to find that in the bladder.\n\nI'm not an expert but it sounds odd if this keeps happening for a couple of years.  I'd suggest seeing an expert to figure this out.\n\nI had a contaminated well when I lived in the country in Pennsylvania.  They told us to not even bathe in the water and certainly not drink it or use it for cooking.  We had to get a big chlorination/purification system on the line.  The water source was contaminated from bovine feces because of all the cattle farms in the area.\n\nMike\t\t\t", "date": "2011-08-05T19:52:02+00:00", "topic": "Having Bladder removed", "subforum": "6-men-and-bladder-cancer"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tBill,\n\nE coli is naturally occurring in ALL mammals.  It is in the intestines. Unless the man you talked to had this \"e coli infection\" confirmed by the urologist who did the surgery (assuming that it is a highly experienced surgeon) then I'd be a bit suspect of the diagnosis.\n\ne coli infections are rare and there are some things that could make one higher risk.  For example, if you had a neo and had to self cath periodically and you reuse catheters and you aren't careful to be sure you wash your hands and you wind up coming into to contact with your own feces or any kind of bacteria you could wind up with an infection of some sort.  They are not that common though.  I am going on three years with a neo and never had an infection (knock wood!  Oh damn--now I've probably jinxed myself).\n\nOne thing that those of us with neobladders, Indiana pouches, or any other continent diversion have to keep in mind is that there is a huge difference between \"colonization\" and \"infection\".\n\nWhenever I get a urine test, it looks like World War 3 in there.  All sorts of things are present but they cause no symptoms and there is no sign of infection.\n\nI had a few urine tests done when hospitalized for other things and they all start freaking out and making plans to bring in tanker trucks and SWAT teams armed with every antibiotic known to man.  However, I never really had an infection.  Once you get continent diversion you have to be sure that anyone who tests your urine knows about it or they all go into cardiac arrest when they look at the test results.\n\nInfections can happen with or without a neobladder but sanitary precautions can greatly reduce the chances of getting one. If you do get an infection it can be treated and eliminated.  Not getting your bladder out when you need to greatly increases your chances of being dead, and as far as I know that isn't so treatable with antibiotics or anything else.\n\nGetting radiation can make getting the bladder out and getting a neobladder or Indiana pouch (IP) in the future a MUCH more difficult surgery for both you and your surgeon.  If Dr. Lamm is recommending removal, well it's your choice.\n\nAlong with Pat, I wonder how many neobladders or IPs he does.  You want someone who is doing 50 or more a year of the kind of diversion you prefer.  He is the world renowned specialist on BCG treatment.  I just don't know how many bladder removal/diversions he does on a regular basis.\n\nMike\t\t\t", "date": "2011-08-05T19:52:02+00:00", "topic": "Having Bladder removed", "subforum": "6-men-and-bladder-cancer"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tI don't think you will have a problem with a local uro doing some of the follow up. They may even be able to recommend someone local to you when you are at MD Anderson. MD Anderson is one of the top places so, if it were me....\n\nTwelve a year is not enough in my humble opinion. Fifty a year or more is where you want to.  A hundred a year is even better.\n\nThe answer to number three is that the urethra is sewn to the neobladder.  Similar to the way the ureters are sewn to the neobladder at the top, the urethra is sewn at the bottom.\n\nOn the how many neobladder questions, I would suggest following that up with \"and what percentage had complications, what kind of complications?\"\n\nAnother thing about MD Anderson is your getting a team, not just the surgeon.  You want the best surgeon you can get but the team is important as well.  While your surgeon will likely see you every day while you are recovering in the hospital, there will be other doctors seeing you as well.\n\nAlso, nurses are EXTREMELY IMPORTANT!  They are doing the day to day, hour to hour care.  They need to be very well versed in neobladder recovery, complications, etc.  It's not just general surgical recovery--it is specialized.  So again, my bet is that MD Anderson has much better nurses with the kind of experience that would most benefit your recovery.  Again, just my opinion.\n\nLet us know how the interviews go.

Also seems like if a family member is a doctor that they would advise you to do the same thing we keep advising.  Also seems like they should be able to handle themselves in a situation where crappy doctors try to cause an issue over you getting better medical treatment.\n\nIf it is a prostate infection, you should ask about Levaquin for a 30 day dose.  It takes a LONG time of antibiotics to get rid of a prostate infection.\n\nIf the prostate still causes issues with the catheter, then inquire about getting a TUIP.  They make an incision in the prostate to loosen it up in the area of you urethra.

I just wanted to let you know that self catheterization and neobladder are NOT necessarily the same thing.  Prior to the surgery, I asked my uro about catheterization and he said \"Why in the world would you want to that?\". Pretty much said it shouldn't be needed and if it was, to get myself to an ER or urgent care center.\n\nIt is different with women.  They have a much higher probability of having to self cath.\n\nAlso, once your bladder and the all-so-constricting (on the urethra) prostate are out, there isn't anything blocking the way for a catheter if you had to get one done at a hospital.  In other words, the part that is painful now will be gone after RC surgery.  If it gets to surgery...\n\nIf you are getting BCG and you are having problems with the prostatic sphincter, ask your doctor about a TUIP \nwww.mayoclinic.com/health/tuip/MY00599\n or the microwave procedure (TUMPT)\nwww.mayoclinic.com/health/tumt/MY00607\n that can alleviate the symptoms of BPH and give a better opening (less constriction from the prostate on the urethra).\n\nIf you are doing BCG, you may want to try to get the procedure after your first series and before you start the maintenance.  I had a TUIP, but they discovered I had a recurrence that was invasive so I never found out if it helped or not.  Went into RC surgery pdq after that.\n\nI had originally been scheduled for the TUMPT (painless procedure done in the Uro's office but takes 6 weeks to a few months to be truly effective).  That's when I had positive cytologies and we started trying to figure out where it was so the prostate issues went on the back burner.\n\nIt's probably worth you checking out the procedures and discussing with your uro.

I did get out on Tuesday as the blockage cleared up Monday night. That's a lot of days on barely any ice chips but I did not want to take the chance on too many ice chips for fear of getting that $(*% NG tube.  I had that aftr my ilius from the RC surgery and do not want that thing up my nose and down my belly every again!\n\nI also found out that instead of stitches, I have two rows of titanium stapes in my intestine.  I also learned that they don't use the end of the small intestine (where it meets the large intestine) anymore due to the B12 dificiency risk.  Mine was cut right about the middle of the small intestine and now that I have had the blockage, I can pretty much pinpoint exactly where the stapled section is.\n\nStaples, apparently don't allow for the same amount of stretching as stitches after healing.  Now I know to be more careful so hopefully I can avoid that problem again.  At least I will know what it is if it does happen again.\n\nSo....if you also got stapes, be careful of organges, tangerines, strawberries, artichokes, and similar foods.  Chew things like steak and fibrous vegatables even more than you used to.\n\nThe intestinal blockage and bowel changes are two things I didn't see anything about in my pre-surgery research.  Maybe these posts will show up when people (in my previous position) do searches.  Had I known about the staples versus stitches, I would have asked my Dr. about it ahead of time and at least been involved in the decision (with knowledge of the pros and cons of each).  I'm not saying it would have been a different result, but I would have at least known of the risk and had some clue as to what was going on when I did get the blockage.\n\nFor those that don't know:  As your intestines push the food along, it isn't a steady continous slow push all of the time.  It is a push, relax, push, relax.  If you get a blockage, you get intense pain when the intestines try to push.  If it doesn't clear on its own, then surgery is needed to either squeeze the food through the constricted/blocked area or cut the intestines to remove the blockage.  Actually cutting them is quite rare though as usually the squeezing through works.  The pushing pain comes on strong, goes away completely and comes on strong a few seconds or minutes later.  My mistake was also thinking \"Gee, maybe I need to eat something\".  If you each much after you get the blockage, most likely you will vomit it up.  That's probably better than having too much food in there getting pushed up to the blockage point.  Morphine slows the action of the intestines and gets rid of the pain.  I would not suggest trying to treat yourself by not eating or drinking as you will get dehydrated if not on IV fluids.  Besides that, I don't know to many folks who can get their hands on morphine for home use.

Be there when he wakes up each time.  My wife was and was the most comforting thing imaginable.  Make him walk. He will not want to but he must.  At least three times a day te first day. Even if it is just walking in place next to the bed.   Do not break ANY rules with regard to him having any liquids or food!   Some people consider that a favor but it is very dangerous. Make him walk some more.  Walking wakes the intestines, which kind of go into shock due to surgery and anesthesia.   The sooner his intestines kick in the sooner he feels better and goes home.\n\nGive him gum to chew but not swallow.  It also sends signals to the intestines to say to wake up.\n\nBooks are no good because the pain meds make reading not possible.  Be sure he keeps the pain manageable but not completely gone.  If he constantly rides that morphine button it prevents the intestines from waking up so it is balance.\n\nThat's my advice but I'm sure someone will come up with teddy bear or something else.

We are ALL different.  It \"hits\" each of us differently and all we can do is process in our own way at our own pace.\n\nWhat happens a lot is that couples each try to be the strong one for the other and they don't share how they really feel.  Other times they share and the other isn't ready to hear.\n\nExample>\nSpouse: I am afraid of losing you and don't know what I'd do if you died.\n\nPerson with cancer: Well gee, apparently it's all about you!  I'm the one with cancer you know!\n\nThe above can and does happen. At the same time, the above is sometimes thought but never said.  It is perfectly normal for each person to think about it from just their own perspective (patient: I don't want to die;  spouse: what happens to me if he/she dies) as well as (patient: OMG, what must he/she be feeling now?  How can I lessen his/her fear and worry?  Should I share my feelings or will that just scare him/her more? spouse: OMG, what must he/she be feeling now?  Should I share my feelings or will that just put more of a burden on him/her when he/she needs all their strength to face this beast?).\n\nBUT, a strong relationship can get past that and a middle of the road relationship can get even stronger.\n\nEmotions are all over the map for both people in a couple.  Sometimes it is hard to talk about and other times it is easy.  Timing is everything.\n\nDeciding how to tackle it (the cancer treatment) together can be helpful.\n\nCutting each other some slack is also important.\n\nAs you each learn more the fear will reduce.  View this as a team.\n\nAs has been said, your husband's at a very treatable stage.  Even the next stage is very treatable even if the treatment is more aggressive.  Mine went to the T2 (muscle invasive) stage and I had to have my bladder removed, but today that is no big deal and I'm going on four years cancer free.\n\nBased on the concern and posts I've read from both of you, you guys are going to make it through this together just fine.  There will be ups and downs and you are going to get even closer (hard to believe, huh?).\n\nMike\t\t\t", "date": "2012-07-26T19:21:48+00:00", "topic": "In denial", "subforum": "20-caregivers-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tFANNNNNNTASIC News George!

Did a TURB and checked kidneys.  My uro said it was in both my kidneys.

The gum chewing action can quicken waking of the intestines.  The intestines shut down with this type of surgery and waking them up is one key to recovery and getting out of the hospital.\n\nHe should walk at least three times a day.  First day, just walking in place next to the bed is ok.  Then up the hall and back.  Someone should be with him to walk.\n\nAlso, first day can be deceiving.  The pain meds may make it seem like things are pretty darn good but then the pain can creep up on one.  He should use the pain meds but not expect to be completely pain free.  Keep pain under control but not gone.  The reason is that the pain meds slow the waking of the intestines.\n\nCheck with his surgeon about getting an epidural for the surgery.  People who do this tend to have shorter recovery times in terms of intestines waking up.\n\nHe (or somebody) is going to need to flush the Foley catheter that will be in when he wakes up.  The intestine used to make the neobladder will produce mucous and the mucous can clog the catheter so it's important to flush the mucous out regularly.  They will tell you how often at the hospital.\n\nHe's going to have all sorts of tubes and drains so he shouldn't be surprised by that.\n\nThey don't know for sure if a neobladder is possible until they are in there.  Any involvement by the urethra may rule that out.\n\nHe should be very careful about lifting.  Incisional hernias are common and it is very easy to lift to much too soon.  Many of us here have had problems with (myself included).\n\nHe will be given exercises (Kegel's, at minimum) to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles.  Those are the muscles that are key to continence.  Given that he's younger, he may be able to achieve continence sooner than the norm because his pelvic floor muscles are likely stronger than a 40's or older male.  Typical is about a month after getting the Foley catheter out. He will go home with the Foley still in and need to maintain that flushing schedule they give him\n\nThe neobladder will need to be stretched SLOWLY over time.  He will have a schedule of how long to try to hold it between going to the bathroom to allow it stretch.  The size of the neo will only be about 40cc or so in the beginning and the eventual size 400-500cc.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nMike\n\n\nThere are mixed reviews on the harvesting of sperm if chemo is required.

If things didn't go how you wanted, and IF it is in your control to try again, then do it.\n\nTypically, men are more frequent requesters of do-overs throughout the course of the marriage.\n\nBy \"Do-Over\", men mean \"Forget about the the past, it never happened, we will just do it over\".

This time period is usually at least 8-10 years longer than the man considers he has suffered enough...\n\nOK, OK, no cards and letters.  It's a joke.  :silly: \n\nHowever, I do think the concept is great (when used with the men's definition).\n\nOne good thing that women should know about do-overs is that when you use one to have another go at a birthday, it does NOT add any extra years.

I can't imagine the care receiver always being the best one for help and support of caregivers.  They may be a spouse, but...I just don't know.\n\nMy wife already asks me about pain, and I already don't tell her when I do.  The thing is, a givers aren't the same and neither are all receivers.  I think each situation is different and those involved have to have regular discussions about how they define their roles.\n\nIn our case, I'm still working 10-12 hour days and traveling regularly.  When Liz started talking about her being a caregiver, I'm thinking \"hang on a minute, all I was asking was for you to set up some appointments and make arrangements.  What kind of caregiver stuff are you thinking about?  Let's not be jumping the gun on the caregiver stuff\".  NOTE:  Important to mention, she did a FANTASTIC job with setting up appointments, booking flights, and hotels!!!\n\nOf course, the only thing I said out loud was, \"Thanks, great job, couldn't have done it without you.\"\n\nIf things go pear-shaped in my case, then I'm making some notes about the discussions we need to have around this topic.  Since Liz is a nurse, there are things that she could do (if needed) that many couldn't.\n\nI think it's also important that a care receiver shouldn't have the added burden of having to feel guilty for when a caregiver feels down.  Again, this is hard stuff to think through and even harder to put on paper.\n\nI think there CLEARLY needs to be caregiver support groups.  They should include givers, unrelated receivers, and professional counselors (if possible).  Otherwise, the care receiver ends up with two roles really (both receiver and caregiver to their caregiver).\n\nIf you think cancer treatment has a long way to go, just think how much the giver/receiver relationship has to go.\n\nMy intent isn't to make anybody feel bad about their role or how they do it.  It's just putting thoughts on paper and thinking out loud.\n\nNow that I've gone on and on, I think maybe this should have been a different topic and not a reply.\n\nMore on topic to a response:  I think both caregivers and care receivers each hit certain \"Oh crap!\" moments.  Some may be at the same time and some may be unique.  When those hit, there could be some unpredictable outbursts, arguments, or behaviors.  If it is clearly a change (more than a couple of weeks) then it could certainly be depression or another physical problem (for either) and then a doctor consult may be the best approach.\n\nMy heart goes out to the givers and receivers here on these boards.  It's a tough, tough thing.  As many receivers who can reach out to other receivers and givers who can reach out to other givers should.  Widening our support networks just has to be a good thing.\n\nMike\t\t\t", "date": "2008-09-04T20:33:49+00:00", "topic": "Feeling blue &amp;amp; an update on Bob", "subforum": "20-caregivers-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\nwww.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/05/130523082919.htm ", "date": "2013-05-26T13:38:48+00:00", "topic": "Interesting new article", "subforum": "31-articles-of-interest"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tYikes!

Some cancers however, are easier to treat and have better outcomes.  Bladder cancer is one of those.  If it is bladder cancer, then you need to get it treated.  You don't know what that treatment is until you know what it is.\n\nYou do realize, that it very well could be nothing and I'm hoping that is what it is.\n\nIf you are diagnosed with bladder cancer, then go to a bladder cancer specialist (not a general urologist) to get a 2nd opinion.  If it is a \"watchful waiting\" treatment plan (likely if low grade T0) then you can go to you local urologist for that on a regular basis.  If it is BCG (likely if high grade T0) then you can also do that at a local urologist.

Bowel complication can be from \"I seem to have to poop more often than before\" or \"I seem to be more sensitive to dairy products\" up to \"I've needed sixteen more surgeries on my bowels because the stinking surgeon screwed up and attached my bowels to other organs and forget to sew me up\".\n\nWith 80% of the patients dying at a mean time of 4.1 years (range 0.1 to 28.1) that doesn't sound like a very good statistic at all.

Here is an excerpt from the text.  \n\tInterview w/ Dr. Bela Denes \n\nDo men or women have a better chance of surviving bladder cancer?\n\nStatistics would show that men have survival rates that are 5 to 10 percent higher than for women. It is not clear why this is but the prevailing thoughts are that women tend to be diagnosed a little bit later. There tends to be a delay in diagnosis due to a number of factors, such as being treated for bladder infections. Also, the male and female bladder are slightly different anatomically. When you look at the bladders side by side or microscopically, they have the same type of cells in the same number of layers. The female bladder is much thinner than the male bladder, especially in its muscular wall. Once the tumor reaches the muscle, it's easy for it to penetrate to the outside, so the fact that the female bladder tends to be significantly thinner than the comparable male bladder may be an easier progression for the bladder tumor.\n\nThis sure seems like it must be a major factor in the defference in survival rates.  This article mentions a 5 to 10% difference but my calculations when you look at the number of men and women who are diagnosed each year and the number of men and women who die from it each year, the run rate over the last few years comes out to a 4% higher rate for women.\n\nIf women have \"much thinner\" bladders and the rate of growth for a bladder tumor is the same, then the amount of time for a woman to progress from one T stage to the next would be significantly less than for a man.\n\nIf we follow that logic, it would seem to be a logical conclusion for the recommendation to be that for a woman with symptoms to ALWAYS get referred to a urologist rather than accepting a GP's or GYN's opinion regarding UTIs or blood in the urine.\n\nMike\n\nP.S: I did some searching and found a study on bladder thickness and men's bladder are generally 0.3mm thicker than women's bladders. Men with enlarged prostate BPE or LUTS generally have even thicker bladders.  Bladder wall thickness increases slightly with age in both sexes equally.\n\n\n\tLink to the study.\n (BWT means Bladder Wall Thickness).\nMean BWT was 3.04 mm in healthy women, 3.33 mm in healthy men, and 3.67 mm in men with LUTS and BPE. Sub-dividing normal men into different age groups showed an increasing mean BWT of 3.08 mm (<20 years, n = 27), 3.25 mm (21\u201340 years, n = 75), 3.42 mm (41\u201360 years, n = 39), and 3.57 mm (>60 years, n = 31) for those sub-groups. BWT in normal adult women is 3.0 \u00b1 1 mm and 3.3 \u00b1 1.1 mm in normal adult men.\nSo if I interpret this data correctly, women's bladder are 10% thinner than men's. The difference would be even greater when compared to men with enlarged prostate (which is very common starting around age 40).\t\t\t", "date": "2010-09-23T21:26:18+00:00", "topic": "Men and Women have differences in their bladders", "subforum": "31-articles-of-interest"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tSeems like the direction should be to change the surgical standards to suggest to surgeons that they minimize urethral resection as much as possible and additionally consider utilizing methods of urethral reconstruction (such as grafts from either genital and extragenital skin flaps, and peritoneal grafts or an acellular tubular matrix seeded with epidermal cells) when higher levels of urethral resection are deemed to be required.\n\nBut hey, that's just me.  \n\nMike\t\t\t", "date": "2010-09-23T17:16:05+00:00", "topic": "Hypercontinence in the female neobladder", "subforum": "31-articles-of-interest"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tThanks for finding the full report Martin!

Over the past 2 decades, in fact, length of hospital stay has decreased by half from an average of 14 days to an average of 7 days.

Some variability exists in the definition of POI since time to return of peristalsis and time to first passage of flatus, which are commonly referred to as indicators of bowel activity, have their own weaknesses, observer dependent and time dependent, among other variables. A number of causes have been recognized to induce or maintain the condition of ileus. Some among them are part of the perioperative period. The practices of mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) and of fasting before surgery have been challenged and can be safely abandoned. The perception of pain is an acknowledged promoter of POI; therefore, providing complete pain control constitutes the rationale in favor of administering anesthesia and analgesia combined, both in the form of concurrent general and epidural anesthesia (i.e., at the thoracic level, T9, T11), and represents the mainstay of intraoperative measures. Hypovolemia is also associated with an increased risk of POI. The use of nasogastric tubing (NGT) has been associated with increased pulmonary complications; moreover, bowel resection can be performed safely without postoperative NGT. Early postoperative provision of artificial nutrients has shown beneficial effects, both in the form of total parenteral and enteral nutrition (PEN, EN).\n\nWe devised a perioperative care regimen, adopting a multimodality approach aimed at minimizing the effects of the above listed factors to ascertain if they could contribute to preventing or reducing POI and the complications associated with radical cystectomy and intestinal urinary diversion. In addition, we investigated the impact of early artificial nutrition, combining PEN and EN via a jejunal nutrition cannula. Time to return of bowel movements, time to reinstitution of a regular diet, presence and duration of POI, and incidence and nature of complications constituted the study end points. Of 143 consecutive patients, 107 who underwent radical cystectomy with intestinal urinary reconstruction were able to be evaluated for results and complications. The male to female ratio was 86:21, the mean age was 74 years, and more than two-third belonged to the American Society of Anesthesiologists categories II and III. Pathologic stages of disease were bladder confined in 48 patients, locally advanced in 33, and extravesical in 26. Urinary diversion with intestine consisted in the configuration of heterotopic reservoirs in 39 patients, orthotopic substitution in 38, and uretero-ileo-cutaneostomy in 30. Bowel movements returned after a median time of 2 days (range, 1\u20136), and the median time to reinstitution of a regular diet was 4 days (range, 3\u20139). POI beyond postoperative day 4 was observed in 17.7% of the patients. Overall, a total of 28 patients (26.1%) experienced complications, specifically, medical complications in 19 patients and surgical complications leading to relaparotomy in 11. The mortality rate was 3.7%. No effects were observed on postoperative protein depletion, despite the provision of early artificial nutrition.\n\nOur results suggest that a short median time of return of both peristalsis and flatus, and to regular diet resumption with a low incidence of POI, can be obtained in the majority of patients with a perioperative regimen aimed at reducing the effect of some of the causes associated with induction or maintenance of POI.

They have options available to make things work while you are waiting for the nerves to kick back in and do things normally so it's not like you have to wait until it does normally.\n\nSince you mentioned stromal invasion, the nerve sparing surgery may be more complex than normal so that is why you want a top bladder/prostate surgeon on your team.\n\nFeel free to ask anything and everything that comes to your mind.

It's certainly tough.\nIn industry, what is sometimes done is to apportion a percentage to each of the categories.  For example, from an IT budget perspective, you have three or four categories:\n-a. Keep the business running (aka keep the lights on)\n-b. Mandatory regulatory/legal/compliance\n-c. Discretionary enhancements/improvements/new capability (evolutionary change).\n-d. Innovation (revolutionary change)\n\nMany times a and b are lumped together because there is really no choice.  Typically, the budget spend is 80% in a, or between a and b. Another 15% get spent in c with the remaining 5% in d.  As in your example, d is where the big potential for huge returns is but it is also the highest risk.\n\nThe really innovative companies, flip the spend by driving down costs of a and further investing in d (20/80) which then helps them even further drive down a.\n\nMaybe someday a similar paradigm could work with research of this type.  Invest is ways to make the ongoing research better/cheaper/faster (not just by cutting funds/people).\n\nAnyway....just random thoughts.  \n\n\n\n\nMike\t\t\t", "date": "2009-06-28T22:42:39+00:00", "topic": "Are the right research projects being funded?", "subforum": "31-articles-of-interest"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tGuess I'm going to have to figure out how to hook up a gin supply to that dispenser in my refrigerator door.

It's OK to ask ANYTHING.\n\nIn my case, I had a high fever and chills and just an overall nasty reaction on my 2nd instillation of BCG.  I had a few mitomycin treatments after that and I think it was just considered that we were done treating and went into wait and see mode.\n\nLet me further explain however that after having the reaction to the BCG, I followed up with Dr. Lamm (pretty much the main BCG doc in the world) over his website to see about his opinion of getting lower doses of BCG.  He thought i would be ok but that it should be closely monitored.\n\nMy local uro didn't agree and didn't want to risk it.  One further complication in my case is that I travel all the time on business but usually fly home Thursday nights.  I was getting my BCG treatments on Friday afternoon.  My reaction happened Friday night and through the weekend so I was calling the on-call uro about the complications.\n\nHad I been getting BCG on days where the followup would have been during during the work week, I don't know if that would have made a difference.\n\nBased on the stats, I REALLY, REALLY wanted to do BCG but based on my symptoms (and situation) I think the risk of sepsis was too high and that can get fatal pretty quick.\n\nIf I had it all to do again, I would still have done the BCG and found someone that would do lower strength doses.  The effectiveness is so great for CIS that (for me) I would really try to do that.  That would have been followed up with regular visits (like I did anyway) to keep an eye on it for chance of recurrence.  If it recurred, then I would have gone for the RC.\n\nIt's your decision, but I can tell you there are lots of folks on this site that were successfully able to do the BCG treatment and have not had recurrences.\n\nI don't think BCG increases UTIs so I'm not sure about that one.\n\nOn the other hand, there are also doctors that try to save the bladder as long as possible, and that's not really good either.\n\nIf you have just CIS and nothing else, I'd think BCG is worth a shot with close followup cysto AND cytologies every 3 months (not just the NMP22 urine test).\n\nFeel free to ask anything any time Al.

The day after she died, my 4 year old daughter Meredith was crying and talking about how much she missed Abbey..  She asked if we could write a letter to God so that when Abbey got to heaven, God would recognize her.  I told her that I thought we could so she dictated these words:\n\n\"Dear God,\n\nWill you please take care of my dog?  She died yesterday and is with you in heaven.  I miss her very much.  I am happy that you let me have her as my dog even though she got sick.\nI hope you will play with her.  She likes to play with balls and to swim.  I am sending a picture of her so when you see her You will know that she is my dog.  I really miss her.\n\nLove,\n\nMeredith\"\n\nWe put the letter in an envelope with a picture of Abbey and Meredith and addressed it to God/Heaven..  We put our return address on it.  Then Meredith pasted several stamps on the front of the envelope because she said it would take lots of stamps to get the letter all the way to heaven.  That afternoon she dropped it into the letter box at the post office.  A few days later, she asked if God had gotten the letter yet.  I told her that I thought He had.\n\nYesterday, there was a package wrapped in gold paper on our front porch addressed, 'To Meredith' in an unfamiliar hand. Meredith opened it. Inside was a book by Mr. Rogers called, 'When a Pet Dies..' Taped to the inside front cover was the letter we had written to God in its opened envelope.  On the opposite page was the picture of Abbey & Meredith and this note:\n\n\n\"Dear Meredith,\n\nAbbey arrived safely in heaven.\n\nHaving the picture was a big help. I recognized Abbey right away.\n\nAbbey isn't sick anymore. Her spirit is here with me just like it stays in your heart.  Abbey loved being your dog..  Since we don't need our bodies in heaven, I don't have any pockets to keep your picture in, so I am sending it back to you in this little book for you to keep and have something to remember Abbey by...\n\nThank you for the beautiful letter and thank your mother for helping you write it and sending it to me.  What a wonderful mother you have.  I picked her especially for you..  I send my blessings every day and remember that I love you very much.\n\nBy the way, I'm easy to find, I am wherever there is love.\n\nLove,\n\nGod\"\n\n<The above store is true.

Gee, sound familiar to anyone????\n\nTotal incontinence after prostatectomy is pretty high when done by less experienced surgeons.\nLong-term incontinence\nIf incontinence persists for more than 18 months, your doctor may suggest one of the following treatments:\n\n\u2022When incomplete closing of the urinary sphincter causes persistent stress incontinence, a series of collagen injections may be given to narrow the bladder neck and reduce leakage.\n\n\n\u2022Men with overflow incontinence can help prevent too much urine from collecting by learning to insert a catheter periodically to drain their bladder. A condom catheter placed over the end of the penis drains leaking urine into a bag that is worn under the man's clothing.\n\n\n\u2022A stricture (narrowing) of the urethra caused by scar tissue can block the flow of urine and result in overflow incontinence. Strictures can be treated by incising the scar tissue surgically or by dilating (stretching) the urethra.\n\n\n\u2022In severe and persistent cases of incontinence, an artificial sphincter may be implanted surgically.\nI don't know about the success rate for artificial sphincters.  I am sure that one of the key factors there is experience of the surgeon as well.  I do know that excellent surgeons do surgery at vet hospitals in addition to their teaching hospital surgeries.  So checking out top doctors is important.\n\nPat is the master of finding the right surgeons so maybe she has some pointers for how to find them for urinary sphincter surgery.\n\nIt sure doesn't sound like it could get much worse so it might be worth at least getting the surgery.  If it doesn't work, then he can go to condom catheters with a leg bag.\n\nAs you can see in the quote above from the article, what they do depends on the reason for the incontinence.\n\nDo you know if he did kegels after the surgery to gain continence?\n\nMike\t\t\t", "date": "2010-02-26T22:37:42+00:00", "topic": "QUESTION ABOUT PROSTATE SURGERY", "subforum": "17-chit-chat"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tI know there are a lot of folks here in Cancun that had trouble getting here or trouble getting home because of the snows.\n\nDoesn't look to a problem for us to get back to Denver later today though.  \n\nAmazing how fast a week at the beach goes by!\n\nNext trip is going to be a weekend of skiing back home in Colorado.

She's on oxygen and feeding tube.\n\nMy father-in-law wants to move back to California with her and I'm looking for options on getting her there.  My wife will accompany her (she's a nurse).\n\nWhen we brought her here she was in much worse shape and she came on a private air ambulance at a cost of around $16K.  Since she is much more stable condition, there may be cheaper options.  Since she is much more stable, they are now quoting $14K, but it seems like there has to be a less expensive way.\n\nMy wife says no to commercial airline because of the incontinence and there is no place that they could change her if there was a bowel movement on the plane.  I suggested immodium or something like it but that didn't go over so well with my wife.  What do I know?\n\nAnother thought is a train, but there is nothing direct.  Would have to go Denver to Sacramento and then to Bakerfield.  Bakersfield is two hours away from where she'd be going so we'd have to get a wheelchair accessible van or something from there.  Still, I'm not sure if that rules things out and I'm wondering if anyone has had any experience with different options.\n\nI suppose there may be some other form of ground transport where they would stop one or two nights along the way at hotels but I don't know of such services.  It's about a 20 hour drive from here to there.\n\nAny ideas are welcome.

If you are using Word versions prior to Word 2007, then:\n\n-To Bold something, you should have a bold looking letter B on your toolbar across the top of the screen.  If you highlight the word you want to make bold and then click on that B, it will bold it and nothing else.\n\nEasiest way is to type all of it and then go back and just click each word you want bold.\n\n-To reset capitalization, select Tools (from the toolbar), then Autocorrect options, then the Autocorrect tab, then uncheck the box that says capitalize sentences.  That should stay set every time you come back into Word.\n\nIf you have Word 2007, then click the \"Home\" tab.  The bold letter B should then be displayed in the upper portion of the screen.  Do it the same way I described above.\n\nFor autocorrect: Click the Microsoft Office Button, and then click Word Options (button on the bottom).\nIn the Word Options dialog box, click Proofing, and then click AutoCorrect Options.

The camera plates, however, still read \"HAL 9000\".\n\nAlthough it is often conjectured that the name HAL was based on a one letter shift from the name IBM, this has been denied by both Clarke and 2001 director Stanley Kubrick. In 2010: Odyssey Two, Clarke speaks through the character of Dr. Chandra, who characterized this idea as: \"tter nonsense! [...] I thought that by now every intelligent person knew that H-A-L is derived from Heuristic ALgorithmic\".[2][3]\n\nClarke more directly addressed this issue in his book The Lost Worlds of 2001:[4]\n\nAs is clearly stated in the novel (Chapter 16), HAL stands for Heuristically programmed ALgorithmic computer. However, about once a week some character spots the fact that HAL is one letter ahead of IBM, and promptly assumes that Stanley and I were taking a crack at the estimable institution ... As it happened, IBM had given us a good deal of help, so we were quite embarrassed by this, and would have changed the name had we spotted the coincidence.\n\n ", "date": "2009-06-12T02:18:19+00:00", "topic": "H.A.L. the Computer", "subforum": "17-chit-chat"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tI'm not sure if this is the appropriate spot for this message or if it should be in caregivers forum or elsewhere.  In any case, I'll put it here in the hopes that it can be useful for folks.\n\nLast year, a good friend's wife had some major back surgery.  In order to keep everyone informed, their daughter created a web site at \nwww.caringbridge.org\n.\n\nThe service is free, has step by step instructions for creating a simple web site that you explain the story (what happened to the person), post pictures, and create regular journal updates.  Friends and family can go to the site, read the daily (or whatever interval somebody makes them) updates and sign the guestbook with well wishes.\n\nA few months ago, my mother-in-law had a severe brain stem stroke.  My father-in-law was quite stressed just with that situation let alone trying to keep everyone informed of the situation and what progress or lack of progress there was.  Because I knew about the CaringBridge site, I created one for him and all he has to do is put in journal updates.  People can sign up to be notified via email whenever there is an update to the site.  It alleviated a LOT of stress for my father-in-law as he was reliving moments each and every phone call and that was really hard on him.\n\nFor people who don't use computers, I suggested that he accept offers of help from others who do have computers and ask them to call others when they see an update on the caringbridge site and let them know how things are going.\n\nThere is no charge for the service and I can't tell you how much difference it has made for us.\n\nFor those that need to keep friends and family updated it is a fantastic tool.\n\nWhen people sign the guestbook, my father-in-law prints them out and takes them to the hospital and reads them to my mother-in-law.\n\nI am in no way associated with the site other than having used it to keep track of my friend's wife and having created a site for my father-in-law.  I just think it's been a Godsend and wanted to pass the information along to folks here that may also find it useful.\n\nMike\t\t\t", "date": "2009-06-03T12:58:33+00:00", "topic": "CaringBridge Web Sites", "subforum": "17-chit-chat"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tYes!

Also, they speak the language of the country they work in (unlike most in the U.S.).  Most of the taxi drivers don't speak English but if you have gone in cabs in the U.S. you are already used to that.  \n\nThey don't have to get out to open the door of the taxi and you don't have to open it either.  They have a button in front that automatically opens and closes the door for you.  You certainly don't want to be getting germs from touching the door handle of the taxi!  \n\nAlso, did you notice how anybody that was feeling at all under the weather or thought they may have been exposed to a cold or flu was wearing a mask in public?  It is considered basic manners to wear a mask so you don't cause others to become ill.  They give them out free at the train stations and other places.\n\nAlso, their bowing does not spread germs through hand to hand contact the way we do here when shaking hands (after coughing or sneezing into it).\n\nGreat food there too!!!\n\nCan you tell I miss it a bit?
