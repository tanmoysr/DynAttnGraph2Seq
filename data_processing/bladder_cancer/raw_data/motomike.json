The adhesive bag sounds like something Johnson & Johnson invented in the 50's for sandwiches but they work real well.\n\nI decided on the bag. My reasoning may not make a whole lot of sense to some but I thought that having fancy fabricated under the skin bladder might require another operation or two. I read threads here for about 2 weeks. I felt that the bag approach provided easy access should anything need repair or \u2026 A great part of that thinking came from my 30 years as a heat & air contractor. I would often need far longer to repair a unit that was difficult to get to. I charged more too.  The bag has worked pretty well for me. I\u2019m old and forgetful so I date my bags so I know how long it has been on. I change every 6 or 7 days.  Leaks are in the past. It took awhile to get used to the adhesive procedures. I was a little intimidated by the stoma. It kind of looks like raw meat- I guess maybe it is! But I\u2019m used to it. It is pretty tough. After a year without an appt.,  my stoma nurse & I are going to be testing bags with 1 3/8 inch hole or 1 \u00bc inch hole to decide which is the best seal (and best comfort.) If he decides on bags, there are quite quite a few of us here who can smooth out the adjustments he may need.\n\nThis is an anxious time and it was for me too but it was only a week or so after surgery that my Doc came to me with the news- YOU ARE CANCER FREE! I want to wish him the same outcome. We will be watching for word from you.\t\t\t", "date": "2012-09-17T21:44:52+00:00", "topic": "neobladder pros/cons....please help", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tHi Jack, I'm sorry that you are in a bit a medical fix but you have come to the right place for info. One of the big problems with cancer is there just isn't much \"public\" knowledge about it. When I say \"public\" knowledge\" I mean that most of us just don't know much about it. I is a bit complicated. The media likes sound bites and easy medical things to show the public. Much of what is being suggested for you has been done for many years. When I first heard of this and studied up on it on the internet I was amazed that the medical people could take my cancer bladder, throw it away, and give me a stickon plastic bag to do the job. (why not- my teeth are plastic and they work just fine!) Well, to make a long story short- they did that over 4 years ago and I go in once each year to hear that cancer has not returned. There are many of us here who can advise you and guide you in dealing with having a goofy plastic bag hidden under you shirt. If that is the one you chose we can answer lots of questions later. For right now I found it was helpful to take notes when I had Dr. visits. That way I could surf the inter net to beef up my head. Then I could ask better questions when I had my next appt. Ask anything. That's what we are here for.\t\t\t", "date": "2013-10-16T15:43:45+00:00", "topic": "New to the forum", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tSo 2013 will really be a new year and a new life for you.

I\u2019ve been reading posts for 3 years but have seen nothing. I suspect that it is pretty personal. I\u2019m pretty open so maybe I can help with a blog of my experience. Remember it\u2019s an open wound and requires your 100% co-operation.

Depression is a big deal- even dangerous! I was amazed at how depressed other patients were when I was in Keymo. I was on antidepressants and still had difficulty. Have a talk with the Doc on this.\n\nThe bag is like a crying baby. Until he gets used to it- it will require attention often and immediately. At 70 I was at a point in life where I wanted to set in the shade, watch the grass grow and occasionally go pull a weed in my garden. The bag would not allow that life style for me and it will also turn his life around for quite awhile. He will be forced to DEAL WITH IT. Please forgive me for being blunt but I\u2019m sort of having to deal with it still (& my surgery was in May). I\u2019m only slightly ahead of your dad and I still go into a cussing tirade when the bag insists on untimely attention (like 3 am). These are becoming less frequent as I improve with cleaning & applying the \u201cappliance\u201d.\n\nI thought of putting an ad on craigslist for a nearby ostomy nurse but my crises are better now. At 3 a m I also considered a taxi to take me and my leaking *%%^#+~ bag to emergency.\n\nYour dad is independent stubborn and private. He determined this when he didn\u2019t want you in on the ostomy nurse appt. so the bag is a fact of life and he must deal with it. Of course this is a crisis time but it gets better and easier to handle.\n\nOf course you love your dad and would do anything you can for him BUT in the final analysis he is going to have to bite the bullet and come to terms with his future life. You cannot allow his difficulties to impact your mental health, your life or your job. I sence that your dads depression is also becoming yours. Have a sincere talk with you mom & dad.\t\t\t", "date": "2010-12-09T00:12:53+00:00", "topic": "Father having radical cystectomy on Friday", "subforum": "20-caregivers-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tEncouraging news.
