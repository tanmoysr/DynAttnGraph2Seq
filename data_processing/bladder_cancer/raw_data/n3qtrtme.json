I have only had one instance of nighttime leakage but am dealing with the hypercontinence issue.  I'm only 38 and very active with horseback riding and boating, so I was concerned with the functionality and asthetics of anything other than the Studer Pouch I have.  I did not have the DeVinci laproscopic procedure but the 'ol fashion surgeon performed procedure at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.  My doctor, Dr. Barton Grossman, was wonderful about making the opening as small as possible (only from my pubic bone to the bellybutton) and talking about all the pro's and con's beforehand.

My husband and I told our kids (12 & 15) the truth, then they went to the internet for more information.  What you find when you google \"cancer\" isn't always good, so it took a number of discussions to clarify and detail the treatment I was receiving.  At one point, my son asked me if I was going to die.  I assured him that I had the best medical team possible and that we were all working to make sure I didn't die.  He was allright with that answer.  My husband just had another discussion with the kids a few days ago.  They are OK with everything that's gone on and were able to talk about what they would have liked us to have handled differently.  They were hurt that we didn't tell them immediately when we got the diagnosis (we took a few days to figure out what to tell them).  I am lucky to be a survivor at this point but will not hesitate to talk to them if anything else comes up.\n\nGood luck with your own child.  You know him better than anybody in the world, so do what you think is right and be open to talking about whatever questions come up. \t\t\t", "date": "2006-11-06T21:06:34+00:00", "topic": "helping", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tMaria,\n\nI had my R/C done at MD Anderson last year and they were WONDERFUL... treated me like a \"princess\", as my husband says.  He's going through treatment for lung cancer down there at the moment and apparently is not happy that he's not being treated like a \"princess\", too.\n\nI had Dr. Randall Millican for oncology and Dr. Barton Grossman for surgery.  Who do you have?  We've spent a lot of time in the ER with my husband and you are right, they are GREAT!\n\nThe docs gave me about a month-long break between the chemo and the surgery, which was nice.  It gave me a bit of time to feel a bit more normal.  As we found out though, my energy levels were still VERY low.  My husband treated me to a \"Congrats for Getting Through Chemo\" trip to Key West 2 weeks before surgery and I ended up spending most of the trip sleeping in the hotel room.  In hindsight, we'd have been better off planning the trip after I had recovered from the surgery.  Oh, well.  It was still nice to get away!\n\nYou have a great attitute!  It will all be over before you know it and life will be back to normal (for the most part) in just a couple of months after your surgery.  If you need anything or have any questions, let me know.  We're at MD Anderson pretty regularly these days, so maybe we could meet up and chat?\n\nBest of luck,\nChristine\t\t\t", "date": "2008-05-31T01:35:17+00:00", "topic": "Chemo finished", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tGood luck with the shower, but don't force him... he's been though hell already!   \n\nYes, I am STILL tired sometimes.  Over the last month it's been much better but I am not yet back to completely normal energy levels.  I am certainly a lot more energetic than I was right before I was diagnosed and I feel a whole lot better.  It'll come back but will take some time.

I had leg bags, too but it ended up being such a pain to \"rewire\" all the tubing and strap them on for a few hours, then spend 20 minutes cleaning them after use.  I was all about making life easier at that point and carrying bags, although not fun, was easier.  Adhesive remover became one of my best friends during that month, what with all the tape on, tape off, and tape moving that was going on in sensitive areas.  Minimizing the taping was also improved by leaving the bigger bags attached.\n\nThat's just my experience - I am certain there are many, many more people out there with their own  stories to tell,  some probably a lot better and a few may be worse.  I have to agree with you... just getting home was SO, SO nice!\n\nGood luck!\nChristine\t\t\t", "date": "2007-08-05T21:45:49+00:00", "topic": "small question about showering", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tThanks, George!\n\nI have done some googling on this issue and apparently it's pretty common in females who have been through RC.

I am 5 weeks post RC and have been having a problem with hypercontinence, too.  When I had the kidney stents and foley removed, there was a lot of discussion about incontinence but not one peep about hypercontinence.  I have been extremely stressed about the difficulty I have been having trying to urinate.  It's especially hard to start the flow if I really need to go.  I bear down and have tried different positions, running water and breathing exercises with little results.  Stepping into a bathtub each time I need to pee is not going to be practical, although it may be an option occasionally.  I finally just have to cath myself which makes me feel like a total failure.  I have had only 1 incidence of leakage in the middle of the night, which I am incredibly thankful for and we're flushing each evening, so mucous has not been a problem.  The new bladder is holding about 500 cc already.  I gave up on the Kegels because clearly the muscles down there are nice and strong (am  I wrong on this?).  I also have a call into my surgeon but have not heard back from him yet.  Does anyone have any additional ideas?\n\nThanks in advance for your help!\t\t\t", "date": "2006-10-11T13:36:25+00:00", "topic": "Help with Hyper-Continence / Neo-Bladder", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tI am brand new to the board (this is my first post) and was surprised to see that there really ARE younger women out there that are going through the bladder cancer experience.  I am 38 and was diagnosed with very rare squamous cell and transitional cell cancers after my urologist peeked into my bladder and found a huge tumor.  Since the diagnosis on 12/18/06 I have had 4 TURBT's, 4 rounds of chemo and finally the RC with a Studer Pouch on 4/25/07.  I experience the same looks in the urologist's office full of old men but it did score me quick attention and treatment by the Head of the Urology Department at M.D. Anderson.  I became one of his few \"pet projects\".   I have fortunately been declared cancer-free post-op (YEAH!) and am learning to use my neo-bladder.

The help provided made navigating this whole bizarre and unexpected cancer situation as easy as it could possibly be.  A huge thanks to you all!
