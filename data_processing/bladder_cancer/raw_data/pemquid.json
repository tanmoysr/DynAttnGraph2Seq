From my experience, getting used to annual check-ups isn't at all difficult. Due to the type of bladder cancer I had, I only had one initial CT scan prior to my first diagnostic cysto, and have never been recommended to get any since that time.\n\nWe are glad you have joined us in the annual check up club.\n\nAnn\t\t\t", "date": "2014-11-07T16:43:41+00:00", "topic": "Clear Annual Check", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tOnce you have more information from the biopsy of your tumors, you will have a better idea of what's happening and where to go from here. There will be three pieces of information you'll need to know and should be given: (1) type of tumor e.g., transitional cell (the most common type) and its form, e.g., papillary (sticking out from the bladder wall, like a little mushroom); CIS (carcinoma in situ, flat on the bladder wall). (2) Grade: how abnormal the cells look-low grade are close to normal cells, high grade are very \"deranged\" and abnormal looking. (3) Stage: how far the cancer has penetrated the bladder wall. You should also find out how large the tumors were, as that can also influence treatment recommendations. There is a lot of information on this site that explains all this in more detail.\n\nThe procedure for removing tumors is called a TURB or TURBT, and involves excising the tumor from the bladder wall. I'm not quite sure why the term \"scrape\" is used, which makes it sound something like shaving, which it really isn't. The Dr. will often excise an area surrounding the tumor, and will try to go deeper than he thinks the tumor has progressed. Getting good \"margins\" both allows for better diagnosis, and also makes it a bit more certain that the Dr. has gotten out everything he/she can. It is common (and often advised) that a second TURB be done some weeks later, to make sure everything was removed, either by the same Dr. or another one if you are seeking a second opinion.\n\nAs to the \"chemo\" the Dr. was going to instill in your bladder, it was not the type of chemo given in other cancer treatments, but most likely something like mitomycin which is often given to stimulate the bladder's immune response. It's not the end of the world you weren't able to get it, but the reason sounds a little odd to me. I can't quite imagine a urologist excising a tumor to the depth that it would potentially compromise the bladder wall and cause leaking of the mitomycin.\n\nI'm not sure how your urologist would know you've had this bladder cancer for a long time. Maybe you should ask him when you go for your follow-up appointment. Xrays would not show bladder cancer; if the tumors are flat (CIS) and they aren't looking closely for them, I'm not sure they would show up on MRI either, but I'm no expert. I presume some of these xrays and MRIs were done in connection with the kidney stones. I had a papillary tumor which was suggestive in an ultrasound exam; followed up with a CT scan which revealed it more clearly; and confirmed by cystoscopic exam. Cystoscopy is really the best way to diagnose bladder cancer. Tests of urine for abnormal cells is also sometimes done, but is less accurate than direct visual examination.\n\nPlease come back here after you've learned more. There is a lot of information on the site, and people here who can help with your questions. Even if you just want to \"vent\" or worry, folks will lend a sympathetic ear since so many of us have gone through what you are going through.\n\nAnn\t\t\t", "date": "2014-09-13T15:50:55+00:00", "topic": "Newly diagnosed and new to the forum.", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tCongratulations!

My husband has afib and high blood pressure, and he gets very fatigued due to his blood pressure meds, one of which is also used for his afib (beta blocker?). Dr. is trying to change dosages, change time of day he takes the various meds, etc., to try to resolve the fatigue. (My husband isn't the one who's had bladder cancer; I am.)\n\nI'm a little confused by your saying you had a cystectomy, and that your cancer has returned. Normally \"cystectomy\" means surgical removal of the bladder. Maybe what you had before was TURBT (removal of the tumors) or possibly you had a partial cystectomy, which I don't think is too common. In any case, I'm sorry to hear about the recurrence. CIS, carcinoma in situ, is often treated with BCG. CIS is generally considered a higher grade type of bladder cancer, so I'm puzzled by the report that you have \"low grade cells\" and that it's CIS. \"Wait and see\" is not usually suggested as an option for CIS, where BCG is highly recommended. On the other hand, \"wait and see\" rather than BCG for low grade papillary cancers sounds reasonable given your other medical conditions. Are you absolutely sure the Dr. said you had CIS? CIS is a flat type of tumor on the bladder surface, while papillary tumors stick out from the surface like little mushrooms or broccoli stalks.\n\nI had BCG treatments because I had a recurrence of low grade papillary bladder cancer, and though I tolerated it well, not everyone does.

When I did on-line research when first diagnosed, I read about grading and staging, but the pathology report from my first TURBT did not at all use that language so I had no idea what it meant. Also, in the path reports there is a major difference between \"muscle tissue is not identified\" (i.e., uro did not go deep enough to get a muscle sample)and a statement that cancer cells are not identified in the muscle tissue (i.e., it's not muscle-invasive). How about publishing some typical path reports with \"translations\" that convey to readers how the reports relate to grades and stages, and to expected outcomes?\n\nRegarding treatment, if a single dose of Mitomycin C now seems to be highly recommended after TURBT, why do many uros still not use it (mine included)? (After my second TURBT, 2 years after my first, I had done some research so asked about Mitomycin and was told they only used it for patients who couldn't tolerate BCG.)\t\t\t", "date": "2009-07-02T14:43:20+00:00", "topic": "5 things I wish I knew at dx?", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tBecause they try to keep you as close to a 3-month interval as possible for cysto check-ups, after the first 6 weeks of BCG the cysto would in fact be about 6 weeks later.

My dad had bladder cancer when he was in his 70s, back when the treatment was just removal of the tumor (no BCG or mitomycin yet). He had one recurrence, and of course we were all worried to pieces. As it turned out, that was all he had, and he died in his 80s (from metastisized lung cancer, unrelated to the blc, but related to smoking); he had been clear for some time of bladder cancer, and was on just annual blc check-ups at the time of his death.

I forgot if you've mentioned it, but how long was it from the time of the last BCG treatment to the current cystoscopy? Some people's bladders react more strongly, and the lining can stay abnormal-looking for awhile.

Maybe I'm overly optimistic (or self-delusional) but right now I truly believe I'm going to live a full and long life in spite of having bladder cancer (granted, I'm already 65, but I'm otherwise very healthy and have long-lived family members on both maternal and paternal sides). Not to play amateur psychologist, but I think one's personality (and support system) plays a role in how one reacts to cancer. All of us have times when we feel blue, angry, frustrated with having blc. But, my own way of coping with illness or other \"bad\" things happening in my life or my family's life is to try to cope with it and move on as if it wasn't there, at least on a day to day basis. Again, it's perhaps easier for me to do this as my cancer is (knock wood) the \"best\" kind of blc one can have.\n\nMy dad had blc in his early 70s (was a smoker), had one recurrence at some point, then was all clear until his death at age 84 from unrelated lung cancer. This was back in the days when the only treatment was TURBT.  When I had my first tumor in 2006 (low grade, non invasive), I got it in my head that I was going to follow in my dad's footsteps. Therefore, I was really shocked (and mad) when I had a recurrence of two tiny (pinhead size) tumors at the 2-year point. I was more upset then than I ws at the time of the initial diagnosis. My uro has put me on the BCG protocol (6 weeks, just completed, no side effects), with maintenance therapy thereafter. I read all I could, and questioned whether I really needed BCG at this point for low grade tumors which hadn't showed up until 2 years after the initial tumor. I called my cousin, who is a research radiologist specializing in the urinary tract to ask him what he thought. He said that the BCG was not a bad idea now, as the new tumors were in different parts of the bladder, and neither was in the same place as the original one. He said, \"What this shows is that your bladder lining wants to grow tumors.\" Both he and my uro refer to these low grade papillary tumors as \"nuisance cancers.\"\n\nAlthough I was initially hesitant about the BCG, my feeling right now is that if BCG can indeed slow up the rate of recurrence (so I won't need too many TURBTs in the near future) and if it reduces the likelihood of progression, I'm all for it. On the other hand, if my uro (like yours) had said \"let's wait and see,\" after removing the two new tumors, I'd have been perfectly OK with that as well.\n\nI guess my advice to you is to go with what your uro is recommending for now. If you have a recurrence in the near future (3 months, 6 months) or if a recurrence is different than what you've had (bigger, more tumors, different grade or stage) then definitely another course of action should be considered.  I think there's some research that suggests that immediate TURBT or \"zapping\" may not be warranted for single small, low grade papillary tumors, but just \"watchful waiting.\" (Repeated TURBTs and fulguration can do damage to the bladder, and possibly in the long run reduce the capacity to hold urine.)\n\nFinally, helpful as this Website and forum are, I think you can get yourself overly worked up by reading about dire things happening to others. Those who are chugging along without invasive or metastatic cancer, not having recurrences, or getting an occasional recurrence and having it treated, are way less likely to be active participants on the forums. Statistics are in your favor (and mine), but it's much harder to relate to statistics than to personal stories; and certainly a number of the folks on this forum are living with (or have gone through) some pretty serious stuff.\n\nAnn\t\t\t", "date": "2008-09-20T16:17:05+00:00", "topic": "I need input from you all", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tI'm glad to hear your procedure went well.

If you do not have insurance, some doctor's offices are willing to charge patients on a sliding scale based on income. It might not hurt to ask. If you do have insurance, some insurance plans will pay for procedures done in the hospital (outpatient surgery) and won't pay for the same thing if done in the doctor's office.

I hope this link will open up without you having to sign up for the NY Times online (which is free).\n\nI well remember when my Dad had lung cancer, for which he was fairly successfully treated with chemotherapy and had a good year, with good quality of life, following the treatment. However, it had metastasized to his liver, and after just a couple of new rounds of chemo they stopped and told him he wasn't strong enough for more \"right now\" (which I think was not true, but was a way of stopping without having him give up hope). Ironically, he'd had bladder cancer over 10 years earlier, with just one recurrence, and was down to bladder check-ups once a year when he died of the lung cancer (age 84). I'm sure his many years of smoking was a major contributor to both the bladder and the lung cancer (though for what it's worth I never smoked and have bladder cancer).\n\nAnn\t\t\t", "date": "2008-08-19T15:37:47+00:00", "topic": "NY TImes article about cancer treatment", "subforum": "7-metastatic-bladder-cancer"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tI'm no medical person, but my impression is that there's been a fair amount of progress in the last 20 years in treating bladder cancer. I think the immune-stimulating treatments (BCG, mitomyicin) have been increasingly refined and work well in certain kinds of instances. i think newer diagnostic procedures are also helpful (e.g., FISH, which I've never had). I've not had to have a stent, but did seem to have a very \"reactive\" bladder in terms of spasms for the first couple of years when I had 2 TURBTs and of course the 3-month cystoscopies. The Dr.'s office gave me anti-spasm medication to take before my check-ups, plus I took over the counter pain meds; both seemed to really help, and eventually I got to the point where the discomfort was really minimal. My innards got used to all the prodding I guess!\n\nIn terms of bladder sparing, I'm not sure there's much new that could logically be done. Once the cancer is invasive, the bladder has to come out, and I don't foresee that changing. Unless there's metastasis, I think the survival rate after that is very good. New types of reconstruction have been developed, when before the only alternative was the external bag.\n\nI do agree wholeheartedly that bladder cancer doesn't get the respect it deserves form the general public. I know I shouldn't get annoyed, but the constant fund-raising and drum-beating about breast cancer gets a little old.\n\nHope things look up for you.\n\nAnn\n\nP.S.

They didn't mention anything about the BCG, which in fact was what I thought might be a deciding factor. By their criteria, it would seem that virtually no one with BLC who stil has a bladder would qualify; after all, even people with no recurrences are still going to be getting checkups for the rest of their life (albeit some may be getting them annually).\n\nAnn\t\t\t", "date": "2010-03-16T15:32:16+00:00", "topic": "U of Hawaii internet based study", "subforum": "31-articles-of-interest"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tSolitary cystic cerebral metastasis from transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder\n\nwww.urotoday.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view_ua&id=2227196\n\nArticle reporting a rare brain tumor metastisis from bladder cancer-with a good outcome.\t\t\t", "date": "2010-02-09T15:59:00+00:00", "topic": "Article: rare brain metastisis - attention Leigh", "subforum": "31-articles-of-interest"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tPat--\n\nThanks for posting.
