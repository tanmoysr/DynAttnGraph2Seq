{"signature": ["TURBT"], "posts": [{"text": "\n\t\t\t\tIt's been somewhere around six months since I posted about the GI problems I have been plagued with.  This is off topic, but I really wanted to let those of you who were concerned about this know the final diagnosis.  I hate mysteries with no ending!  Before the doctors found that the bladder cancer was confined to the bladder my gp thought the daily nausea was a symptom of cancer that had spread.  I was lucky that it wasn't that.  I finally went to Indianapolis to a specialist and finally have a firm diagnosis of what is causing the GI symptoms.  I have gastroparesis.  \"Paralyzed Stomach.\"  It makes me feel like I have the stomach flu every day and has been going on for over a year now.  I lost 60 pounds in six months but my weight has stabilized now, thank goodness!  I don't have the usual risk factors for it so I go to the University Research Hospital in October to see if they can determine the cause and give me some sort of prognosis.  My doctor says it is more than likely permanent since it has not improved in over a year.  I do have blocks of time when the nausea isn't so bad so I am able to do more now.  I am relieved to finally have a diagnosis, at least.  I am on an extremely limited diet- little fat and no fiber and meds to make my stomach contract.  The doctor says that for unknown reasons the meds will stop working in a couple of months and I will be back to square one.  But by then I will be up for my appointment with the Research Hospital.  Mainly I aim writing about this to thank all those who listened to me belly ache, (no pun intended    ).  You were all so good at keeping my spirits up during those months that I had no idea what was wrong with me... I just knew I was terribly sick.   Especially Rosemary, with her kind words and Wendy, who has been a lifesaver to me.  Thank you all for the support you gave me through the months of worry.  elaine\t\t\t", "date": "2007-08-30T06:59:28+00:00", "topic": "Update on My Other Problems", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tThe section on sexual function sounds promising...

Should be pretty simple to get checked for that.  I was really relieved there was no colon cancer or crohn's or anything.  I don't know what he is doing biopsies for.  A friend told me possibly a type of microscopic colitis, but that is just a guess.\n\nGreg, as always, thanks for reminding me to be careful with diet. I was a bit irritated after the colonoscopy because the doctor's only advise was to take more motrin and more reglan. I came home mad and cut my nose off to spite my face and ate some stuffing.  Ended up sick in bed for a day and a half.  Not going to do that again!!  Mr Rugrat went to the store today and got me some more gluten free, fat free, low fiber type stuff.  It is in the crock pot now and the blender is on the counter handy.  Thank you.... Down to 123 pounds... uggghhh  I think, as you've said, I have to keep my focus on my diet and keeping my weight up and forget about what the doctor is doing.  I'll just show up with my body when he wants it.   ;D I told Mr Rugrat that from now on he is to do all the talking because I can't seem to get him to hear me.\n\nWendy, thanks for the research tips.  I didn't know reglan was used for nausea.  I knew it was an anitanxiety drug and my hubby has used it for years to empty out his stomach faster so the acid doesn't build up and irritate his barrett's esophagus.  So far the neurontin is controlling the bipolar quite well but I did find out after a couple of years sometimes it just stops working.  Will cross that bridge when/if it comes.\n\nYou guys are great support and I really appreciate your time and concern.  Everybody.....\n\nDecember 18 is my bladder recheck and Dr. dugan is going to have a fit that I have gotten so much worse in three months time.  Maybe he'll suggest an Indy doctor!!   ;D\n\nRosemary, thanks for asking about me... i am doing better today.  Will go back and look at the pictures of Kaely and my little Addison.  And the hills of the great smokies. Hope your pain is letting up...\n\nTake care and thank you.  I'll write more when I am on my feet a little more.. I just wanted to check in now.

No signs of major disease!     But strange things are happening. After the colon cleanse, I got up yesterday morning and, (this gets gross, you may want to stop reading... :-[ ),  passed a bunch of green bile looking stuff.  The dr photographed pools of this green stuff in my colon and gave us the pictures.  No explanation.. he is just doing tests.  Is it normal to have that much bile in you after a colon cleanse and no food for a day and a half?  I am elated that there was no cancer or crohn's or anything like that but the fact is I am still very sick and Mr Rugrat is getting insistent that they come to a conclusion soon.  I wake every morning sick, nausea.. bad.  I start getting watery diarrhea and after a couple of hours of that the nausea goes away.  I eat an egg for breakfast and do pretty well for a couple of hours then it all starts over. Wednesday I had diarrhea 10 times between 6am to 5pm.  Lots of it.  I have a fair amount of pain on my right side where the gall bladder scars are.  I have a golf ball size hernia on the top incision.  The dr wants to do a barium swallow next week to rule out problems in my small intestine.  If that is clear we are down to the gall bladder surgery the first of July.  There is a naturally occurring diarrhea you can get after gall bladder surgery called bile salts diarrhea.  There is a sickness you can get if the bile duct was injured during the surgery.  The dr told me to take more reglan.  It is a drug that empties the stomach and intestines out faster.  He would not comment on why it helps even at Mr Rugrat's questions.  We just aren't getting any answers... just more tests.\n\nGreg, I am always impressed with your research and common sense.  I'm not saying that to stroke your ego..  ;D  ;D  If you have any knowledge you would want to share with me I would be very grateful.  The 'eat often and small' has helped a bunch.\n\nWendy, I was very interested in your research on antidepressants. I don't know where you find this info. If you wouldn't mind would you expound on that.  I was on wellbutrin, lithium and zyprexa but stopped taking them when I got sick.  I am on neurontin now.  You know where to look where I don't seem to know.   \n\nI am not depressed and definitely not willing to give up and live like this if I don't have to.  I am determined to get to the bottom of this.  Mentally I am doing quite well.  I am happy, I laugh, but I am getting frustrated and angry at being sick with no answers.  i guess I have one answer... after all these tests I know I am health!   ;D  Just sicker than a dog!   :-/  All three doctors, the gall bladder surgeon, my gp, (dr of osteopath), and now this gastro guy are all members of the same medical group.  Mr Rugrat is thinking maybe I should get out of this group and find someone independent that will be more open as far as findings and possible reasons for this excess bile.\n\nMy cystoscope on my bladder is in 18 days.  The trip to Indy will be hard if I don't get well by then.     (poor me    )  As always I am very grateful to you all for the support through the days of bladder cancer scare and now with your continuing support and wealth of knowledge and investigative power!

The two meds I am on for the stomach problem are helping alot.  I got out yesterday for the whole day and enjoyed it imensely.  My stomach doctor told me that when the new meds don't work or if the nerve damage continues to worsen he does use medicinal marijuana, for \"break though episodes,\" (marninol),  so I guess my mother in law wasn't too far off base after all.  That would only be used if we can't get it under control with other meds.  I am wondering if smoking that would increase the risk of recurring BC, though.

Must be heading your way.\n\nClara,  are the pics coming in ok on email?  I was at the hospital yesterday morning for a test, then spent the afternoon outside and before I knew it I had skipped my daily offering.  I am sending more pics of the Carolina Wren today.  Is will be too cloudy with the snow coming to take new photos anyway.\n\nThank you so much, Elaine\t\t\t", "date": "2007-12-05T22:49:38+00:00", "topic": "It snowed today.", "subforum": "17-chit-chat"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tThanks for being here, Rosemary.

If you don't mind I'd like to use it in my e-mag.  You put a big old grin on my face with that.  Isn't nature just wonderful?  Yes, it was a tad hard the first time I saw a hawk hunting my feeders but I came to a great appreciation for the hunting skill of the bird after awhile.\n\nLast Feb I had a Krider's Red Tail, which is about three times the size of the Sharp shinned and twice the size of a Cooper's, capture and eat one of my squirrels.  He came back three days in a row before finishing with the carcass.  I have some great photos of it.  I know I will get hate mail over this, but after I watched the splendour of that bird right outside my windows I was enamoured by hawks.  I can't bring myself to kill a fly, but I found myself 'seeding' the open area of my lot with shelled corn to coax the squirrels out into the open and thus easier prey for the Krider's.  To my knowledge the Krider's didn't get another squirrel and it wasn't too many days after that we had a major spring thaw\n\nOnce the snow cover melted the hawk retreated back into the open fields.  I am hoping he will come again this winter.  I have a much more powerful camera and lens this year so I am drooling at the thought of the pics I could get.  thanks so much for your story.  It's things like that that make it all worthwhile for me.

No fun, either.  hahaha... (I will fix some fat things for the kids... what is Turkey day without fat?)\nHow old is your grandbaby in this picture?  I bet the two of them could have quite a time together.  Does she live close by?  I am thinking you said they were a distance away... but my old brain can't remember for sure.

You took me through a range of emotions and insight as I read of your chemo journey.  I also appreciated your thoughts of always thinking of someone who has it worse than you.  I have tried to keep that in my mind as I go through this treatment for the gastroparesis.  There are so many people who have it worse than I.  I have great empathy for them.\n\nOne really neat thing is that you brought back a memory from my childhood.  Not a real pleasant memory, but one I and my older siblings have chuckled over for forty-five years.\n\nOne night many years ago my two older brothers and old sister were babysitting when my parents went out.  They turned the tv on and we watched Twilight Zone! Rather, they watched while I cowered behind a chair in the dark!  When my parents came home they found me terrified to go to bed.  Of course my siblings never fessed up to making me watch a scary program so mom and dad weren't sure what to think. My brothers and sister teased me insesantly for months and even years after becuase I was terrified!  That was the only episode I ever watched!\n\nNow I can't wait to talk to them becuase after following your link to the wickapedia site I know the exact date of the episode and the details of the story, (which parts of the episode were not in my memory since I was covering my eyes through much of the program).  Anyway, I am planning to give them much grief over it, all these years later.  If my parents were alive I would consider tattling on them but maybe it's better than I didn't then and can't now becuase they would make me pay dearly!  They love to raze me to this day!  I was 5 and a half years old when that episode aired!  I'm emailing the link to them!  My brother, Rick, will especially love this!!

I didn't win.. didn't really think I would  ;D  but I thought I'd post it here.  The essay is a true story about an elderly woman who I took care of for three and a half years until she died in 2005.  She taught me a great deal about life even though she was ill herself.  I miss her terribly. This essay is my tribute to her and if you all want to vote you still can just click on the stars at the end of the essay.  The awards were decided by judges rather than the popular vote becuase they wanted stories that had to do with the Great Lakes.  My story is more about my friend than the lake itself.  Maybe I'll get lucky and they will give me an honorable mentoin since I think I got the most popular votes.  ;D ;D ;D  That isn't my purpose, I just want to share her story.
