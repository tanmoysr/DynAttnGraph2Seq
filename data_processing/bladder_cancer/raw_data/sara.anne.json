Low-grade means that the cells are only slowly dividing, while high-grade means that they are dividing more rapidly and have a higher chance of spreading if not treated.  There is a lot of information if you go to our Home Page underBladder Cancer 101.\n\nThis form of bladder cancer is highly treatable when found early, as it seems this was.  Often a urologist will do a second TURB (the biopsy surgery) to make sure that he/she got all the possible tumor and to be sure of the diagnosis.  The urologist may also recommend a form of immunotherapy called BCG which is often highly effective, particularly in the case of high-grade bladder cancer.\n\nAs I mentioned above, this type of bladder cancer can be very effectively treated.

A neobladder is more problematic with females than with males often resulting in permanent incontinence or hypercontinence.  This is one topic to have a long discussion with your urologist/surgeon about.  I always advise patients such as you to go to a place that does LOTS of these surgeries and has a LOT of experience with cases such as yours.  USC is just such a place.\n\nThis surgery can be done either robotically or with open surgery, depending on the situation and the expertise of the surgeon.  Your questions about a hysterectomy and post-surgery sexuality are also questions that you need to discuss with the surgeon.  There are options about how much non-bladder tissues/organs need to be removed and, again, this depends on your particular situation.  But an open discussion about your needs and wishes needs to be had.  Often a brief course of chemotherapy is prescribed prior to radical cystectomy to ensure that any spread outside the bladder is caught.  This would not be as bad or as debilitating as what your sister had and, if prescribed, would be a good start to getting rid of this.\n\nRadical cystectomy is major surgery and the recovery time is long.   But it is easier if you start out in good physical condition which you must be in due to your job.  A good mental attitude and determination are also on your side.  I know of patients with neobladders (male) who drive race cars, run businesses, ski, and scuba dive.

I discussed this with my urologist and together we read the current medical literature and \"best practice\" recommendations for urology.  I have agreed to his recommendation for a CT-urogram every five years.  A CT-urogram can identify spread to the ureters and kidneys that would not be visible or discovered any other way.  It is worth it to me since I had high-grade CIS.

Sorry you need to be here, but there are worse things!\n\nIt is true that there is a shortage of BCG.  Only one company produces it for sale in the US and this is a subsidiary of\nMerck.  BCG is a biological product, just as vaccines are, and depends on the \"goodwill\" of bacteria for its manufacture.  If something goes wrong, or contamination sets in, the entire process needs to be stopped and restarted.  Merck has said that the shortage should be over by September.  They have been severely limiting shipments so your husband is not the only one missing out.\n\nThe good news is that your husband has had two treatments and that should have at least started to kick up his immune system.  There is no set protocol for BCG;  often after several treatments irritation sets in and the treatments need to be postponed for several weeks to allow the bladder to heal.  If bacteria are present in the urine BCG will not be given until that is cleared. This does not hinder the effectiveness of BCG. Your husband should be OK and the treatment should be available in the near future.\n\nAs for communication issues, was the information about his diagnosis given in person at an office visit?  Could the woman have been a fellow urologist in the office?  If your husband does not feel comfortable with this practice he could always seek a second opinion elsewhere.  However, for the present, he is \"in line\" for the BCG supply with this office so it might be a good idea to stay put until he has had the six initial treatments.  I assume that they will recommend maintenance treatments, which go on intermittently for about two years, so he might switch, if he is so inclined, before they start.\n\nGood luck\n\nSara Anne\n\nIt is unfortunate that the urologist did not explain this possibility at the start.\t\t\t", "date": "2019-08-06T16:42:18+00:00", "topic": "Initial BCG Treatment stopped on CIS bladder Cancer after Two Treatments.", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tSorry to hear about your issues.

It spreads by growing into the deeper layers and then into the lymph nodes.\n\nAs your doctor has probably told you, CIS is always high grade and requires additional treatment.  The usual treatment is a form of immunotherapy called BCG (sometimes a different substance is used) which stimulates the immune system to reject the cancer cells.  BCG is very effective for CIS.

Bladder cancer, discovered early as yours appears to have been, is relatively easily treated.\n\nYour urologist is of the opinion that the papillary (like a little mushroom on the bladder lining) tumor is about 1 cm in size.  That is relatively small.  The purpose of the TURB (transurethral resection of the bladder) is two-fold.  First is to remove as much of the tumor as possible and second to send that tissue to a pathologist to determine the grade (how fast the tumor is growing) and stage (how far it might have advanced into the bladder/muscle).

These can be either low grade or high grade and this requires pathological examination of the tumor to determine.  High grade tumors have cells with a very abnormal-looking appearance and a large number of which are dividing.  Low grade tumors have cells that are more \"normal\" in appearance and only small numbers of weird and dividing cells.  The size of the tumor is probably more likely to be related to when it was discovered rather than grade.

It shows up as a sort of rash on the bladder surface, and because it is not tumor-like it is sometimes missed on an initial TURB (one reason a second TURB is often done.)  It can present alone or along with the papillary form.  CIS is always high grade.\n\nYou really WON'T know what you are facing until you have the TURB and get the path report back.  THEN you can face whatever it is with some knowledge.\n\nI know that the waiting is difficult, but try not to worry about all the what-ifs and the odds and the possibilities.

Sorry you are facing this, but glad to hear that you are at a really good place for treatment.  Like Alan, I have not faced cystectomy (and hope I never have to) but have already planned what I would do!!  Cynthia, the President of the American Bladder Cancer Society, has an Indiana pouch.  A piece of intestine is re-purposed as a new bladder/reservoir as in the neobladder and the urine is routed via a stoma in the navel or near by.  You use a catheter in the stoma every four hours or so.  I have traveled with Cynthia and if I didn't know and wasn't interested I would never know she has it.  She swims, bathes, scuba dives....no outside appliance and this diversion doesn't have the potential complications that the neobladder has.  Anyway, that is what I would want and you might want to consider it.\n\nYes, the surgery for the ileal conduit is the simplest, but at your age and assuming that you are healthy that shouldn't be a major consideration.  As Alan said, (I usually agree with him) often this is the diversion that the doctor feels most comfortable with.  You do not want a surgeon who is not comfortable with the diversion you choose and does not have the expertise with it.\n\nMy urologist has told me that if it ever comes to a recommendation for cystectomy he would INSIST that I get a second opinion.  This might be a good idea in your case even if your insurance will not allow you to go to another site.  You could request an opinion from another urologist in the same department who has had LOTS of experience with bladder cancer surgery.  After all, YOU or YOUR insurance will be paying big $$$$ for this procedure and you have the right to select what is right for YOU.   I have a friend who recently switched doctors in the same practice and it was no problem at all...just a better fit all around.\n\nWhatever you chose, good luck!!\n\nSara Anne\t\t\t", "date": "2019-04-19T01:40:53+00:00", "topic": "I Feel So Stupid...", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tThis is a question he needs to ask his doctor.

As you may have read, BCG is the treatment of choice for CIS.  Mitomycin is also sometimes used, particularly if the patient is unable to handle BCG for some reason or if, as has been happening recently, BCG is not available.

He should discuss your pregnancy with his urologist and you should definitely discuss the situation with your OB.

IF your situation is low-grade, non-invasive transitional cell carcinoma and it has not spread beyond the bladder lining, your most likely recommendation will be for cystoscopy exams every three months for about two years, every six months until 5 years have passed, and then annually forever.  The reason for the constant monitoring/exams is that bladder cancer of this type has a very nasty little habit of coming back!\n\nIf you do have bladder cancer that is transitional cell carcinoma but high grade, which still has not spread beyond the bladder lining, your urologist will probably recommend a series of BCG treatments.  (I won't go into all the detail about these now, since you may not need them...there is a LOT about BCG on this Forum if you are curious.)  Following that you would have the same constant monitoring noted above.\n\nIF the cancer has spread beyond the bladder lining, your urologist will have multiple options to discuss with you, including consultation with an oncologist.\n\nAnother possibility is that there are still questions after the results from your TURB are in.  It is not unusual for the urologist to do a second TURB to be sure of the diagnosis if there are such questions.\n\nPlease remember that in most cases bladder cancer is very treatable....many of us have been where you are and are doing great with no signs of cancer.\n\nSara Anne\t\t\t", "date": "2019-03-29T18:36:53+00:00", "topic": "Bladder cancer", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tI guess my answer would depend upon how well your father is able to take care of his basic needs .

Sorry that you had to  join us....\n\nAs you might expect, the answer to your question is \"it depends.\"  First, what was your diagnosis exactly?  (The pathology report.)  Was your cancer low grade or high grade?  BCG is not as effective in low grade bladder cancer and is usually used in this case when the tumors return multiple times.  In high grade bladder cancer cases, BCG can be live-saving.  AND, if it can be tolerated, and for most of us it can be, it is much less debilitating than traditional chemotherapy.\n\nAnd here comes the complicated part...the \"it depends\" issue again.  BCG is a modified tuberculosis bacterium that was initially developed almost a hundred years ago as a potential anti-tuberculosis vaccination for children.  In cases of bladder cancer it is instilled directly into the bladder in the hopes that it will still up the body's immune system to fight the cancer cells.

I used to joke that I didn't even know I had a bladder    You will soon be an expert.\n\nYour diagnosis is a hopeful one.  Mine was similar and almost 11 years later here I am...still doing great.\n\nLet me try to decipher what has been going on with you.  The tumor removal that you had was a TURB (transurethral resection of the bladder.)  Its purpose was two-fold, first to remove as much of the tumor(s) as the urologist could and second to have bladder tissue from several sites to send to the pathology lab.  The pathologist examines the tissue samples microscopically to determine a.  IF the sample is cancer;   b.  What grade it is; and c.  If is is still confined to the bladder or if it has spread into the muscle.  ONLY AFTER THE PATH REPORT IS FINISHED DOES THE UROLOGIST KNOW FOR SURE WHAT THE DIAGNOSIS IS.  That is when your doctor knew that it was high grade...he couldn't determine this when he did the initial exam (BTW, that exam is \"cystoscopy.\")\nThe \"chemo\" that you received after your TURB was probably a single dose of mitomycin, which is used to avoid\nany of the tumor cells from escaping and causing more problems.\n\nYou must have a very good urologist, since he scheduled a second TURB now that he knew that it was high grade to be sure of the diagnosis and to remove any other visible tumors.  This is something that should be done if there are any surprises found the first time, and not enough doctors do this.\n\nNow for the treatments you will be having.  I am pretty sure that you will be treated with BCG (another term you get to learn!!)  BCG is a modified live bacteria preparation related to the tuberculosis bacterium.  It is \"immunotherapy\" or \"intravesical\" therapy, NOT traditional chemo.  It will be placed in your bladder once a week and you will try to keep it there for about 4 hours.  Its purpose is to make the bladder a bit \"angry\" by stirring up the immune system and causing it to reject any cancer cells.  This is the treatment of choice for high grade, non-invasive bladder cancer and is a real life saver.  The treatments aren't pleasant, but are NOTHING compared to the systemic chemo that many cancer patients undergo.\n\nThe issues with urination that you describe following your TURB are probably because the bladder was really irritated when the urologist cut the tumor areas out.  As you found out, it does heal after a bit.  As for the constipation issues, one reason for them could be the general anesthetic.  This can cause such a problem in some patients.  This is something that you should let your doctor know right away because he can offer suggestions as to the best way to handle this.\n\nHope this brief explanation helps a bit.  You will have a steep learning curve (we all did) but you are on the right track and will do fine.

I know you don't want to join our rather exclusive  club, but we have all been in a situation very similar to yours.\n\nFirst, I assume that the procedure you had was done under anesthesia and is called a TURB (transurethral resection of the bladder.)  The urologist does two things;  remove as much of the mass as he can and obtain samples to send to the pathology lab.  UNTIL THE RESULTS COME BACK FROM THE PATH LAB NO ONE CAN TELL FOR SURE WHETHER IT IS CANCER OR NOT.  It is very likely that he will have the results during your appointment Thursday since it takes about a week.\n\nAs for what it could be?  it could be a cyst, or a benign growth, or bladder cancer.  IF it is cancer, it has the \"choice\" of being high grade or low grade.  The pathology report should also indicate, if it is cancer, whether it is still contained in the bladder lining or if it has spread into the underlying layers or the muscle.  Often if this cannot be determined from the biopsy samples a second TURB is scheduled so that this can be examined.\n\nWhat happens next depends on the diagnosis.  If it is a cyst or benign growth....probably nothing.  If it is low grade cancer you probably will be scheduled for cystoscopy exams every three months for a while to be sure it doesn't return.

As you are probably aware, bladder cancer has a nasty little habit of returning sometimes.  If your tumors were low grade, and did not return multiple times (and your urologist has to determine what \"multiple times\" might mean) it is possible to go for quite a while with careful surveillance and removal each time.  When \"multiple times\" becomes too much, a different approach is necessary.\n\nIn your case, the initial tumor was high grade.  This means that its cells are rapidly growing and have the potential to spread relatively quickly, which is why your urologist immediately recommended BCG.  BCG is not usually used initially in low grade bladder cancer....only if it repeatedly returns.  If HIGH GRADE bladder tumors return more than a few times and cannot be stopped with BCG, other measures are indicated.  This can include, for example, BCG with interferon.\n\nYou need to sit down with your urologist and have a serious talk about possibilities and options.  And, depending upon where you are being treated, should it return yet a third time you should consider getting a consultation at a center that specializes in difficult bladder cancer cases.  High grade bladder cancer is nothing to fool around with.\nWith good care it can be handled.\n\nWishing you all the best\n\nSara Anne\t\t\t", "date": "2018-06-20T18:11:16+00:00", "topic": "Decided it was time to join in.

I did and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nAs you have guessed, no UTI.  I had a lot of burning and urgency which I had thought was due to the non-existent UTI.  The only difference in my case was that I did not, and never have, had blood in my urine.\n\nI really think that the nurse practitioner saved my life, or at a minimum my bladder.  I was diagnosed with papillary bladder cancer with some \"areas of irritation.\"  A second TURB (biopsy) a few weeks later determined that the area of irritation was CIS...a high grade form of bladder cancer.  I had BCG treatments and now, almost 8 years out, and healthy and bladder cancer-free.\n\nThe CT-urogram should tell the urologist if there is a suspicious area in the bladder or,  less likely, in the kidney.  If there is in the bladder, she will probably want to do a TURB (transurethral resection of the bladder) where,  under general anesthesia usually as an outpatient, she will remove whatever tumor she might see and send samples to a pathologist for analysis.  The pathologist's report is the only definitive diagnosis as to whether it is cancer or not, the grade (how fast it is dividing) and whether it is localized or has gone into the lower layers of the bladder.\n\nThe take-home of this tale is first, that it will be a while before you know exactly what you might be facing, and, second, that if it IS bladder cancer this is something that can be treated.\n\nPlease keep us informed...we are interested in you!!

However, there is no evidence to support this practice.\"\n\nSara Anne\t\t\t", "date": "2017-11-14T16:54:30+00:00", "topic": "BCG treatments", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tSo sorry to hear about your father\u2019s issues    Bladder cancer is usually treated by urologists unless it has spread beyond the bladder lining .   So far what you have reported is exactly what should happen .   Your father will not really know what the exact diagnosis is until he receives a copy of the pathology report following the biopsy   If indeed it is a papillary tumor and if it is still localized to the bladder lining and if it is low grade then it is likely that the urologist would recommend a \u201cwatchful waiting\u201d  with cystoscopy  every three months    If the tumor turns out to be high grade then immunotherapy would be indicated .   This is not usually done with low-grade tumors  because it is not as effective in those cases .\n\nMy suggestion would be to wait until your father has the results of his biopsy and the recommendations from the urologist as to how he might proceed .  At that point he could make a decision as to whether the situation seems straightforward and he is happy with the recommendations or he could seek a second opinion at someplace like MSK.

Be sure to discuss his experience and record with your urologist;  you wouldn't take your expensive sports car to the corner garage for extensive service, you would seek an expert.  You need to be treated at a place that specializes in bladder cancer such as an NCI designated cancer center, a medical school, or other MAJOR cancer facility.\n\nMuch urological surgery is now done with the \"DaVinci apparatus\" in which the surgery is done robotically.

First, you said that your husband had a \"mild\" form of bladder cancer?  Never quite saw that adjective used to describe bladder cancer   Are you sure that it wasn't described as \"low grade?\"  And then he was treated with BCG?  Usually, BCG is NOT used for low grade bladder cancer unless it returns.\n\nCIS (carcinoma in situ) is a form of transitional cell carcinoma that appears sort of like a rash on the bladder rather than a \"mushroom-like\" tumor, which is the other form.  It is always considered high grade, which means that the cells are rapidly dividing and it has the potential to spread quicker than low grade.  Here is a good explanation of CIS\n\nbladdercancersupport.org/diagnoses/carcinoma-in-situ-cis-of-the-urinary-bladder.html\n\nThe treatment of choice for CIS which is still confined to the bladder lining is BCG.  The usual protocol for this is to have BCG instillations once a week for 6 weeks, then for three weeks every three months until 2 years have passed.  I was diagnosed with CIS and underwent this treatment and am now almost 9 years cancer-free!  One of the reasons that BCG is normally not given with low grade bladder cancer that has not recurred is that the body does develop a sensitivity to it (that is what is supposed to happen) and, since it is not as effective in low grade, they are sort of \"saving\" the big guns for when it is really needed.\n\nHas the urologist proposed a treatment plan for the CIS?

This takes about 15 minutes.  If he sees evidence of a growth of any kind, it is likely that he will order a TURB (transurethral resection of the bladder , or biopsy) which is very similar to the cystoscopy except that it is done under general anesthesia so that he can cut out any tumors/growths/abnormalities that he can see.

It is also possible that the urologist may order another CT scan rather than depend on the previous one.\n\nAFTER the cystoscopy you will have a better idea of what you might need/want to ask the urologist.

She is lucky to have you by her side.  I will try to answer a few of your questions, although I have not had a cystectomy, I do know a lot of people who have.\n\nFirst, while there are three general diversion types, they are not all suitable to everyone.  The Neobladder, when it works, can be wonderful.  When it doesn't, the patient can be left either incontinent, or hypercontinent, requiring routine cathetering.  It is also often not as successful in women as in men, and the surgery for it is the most complicated.\n\nThe Indiana pouch does require a catheter to empty the reservoir through a stoma in the abdomen.  Both the Neobladder and the Indiana pouch require a surgeon who does a lot of these specific diversions.\n\nThe ileal conduit is the simplest surgically.  Afterward the patient wears a \"bag\" (similar to that used with a colostomy, to collect the urine.\n\nI know that you have read up on these, but if you haven't seen this web site it is worth checking out\nmy.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/urinary-reconstruction-and-diversion.\n\nAll of these surgeries are major surgery and require a relatively long recovery time.  Whether or not the patient needs to spend time in a rehab nursing facility depends first, on how able the patient is to take care of themselves, and second, on what kind of support and help she has at home.  At the minimum your mother would need someone with her for quite some time who is competent to help her deal with the new reality.\n\nThere is, of course, discomfort following the surgery until the body is healed.  But there should not be any chronic pain after the recovery period.  Most patients adapt well and lead normal lives.

Many general urologists have only been trained to do an ileal condiut.  If that is what is suggested for you, you want to be sure that it is because it is medically indicated and not just because that is the only one the surgeon knows how to do.\nOne type is not necessarily any better than any other....it depends on the patient and his condition and his wishes.\n\nHow do you determine how many a urologist does and what options he is qualified to perform?  YOU ASK.  Sometimes patients are sort of in awe of a doctor....don't be.  You are paying for a service and, just like anything else you buy, it is up to you to find the very best place to spend your money!\n\nIf at all possible it is better to be treated at a large institution such as an NCI-designated cancer center or a university/medical school center.

For BCG, what is most important is the \"grade.\"\nwww.cancer.net/cancer-types/bladder-cancer/stages-and-grades?sectionTitle=Staging\nBCG is most effective for HIGH GRADE tumors, that is those that are rapidly dividing.  T1 or T2 tumors can be either low grade or high grade. CIS is ALWAYS high grade and requires immediate treatment because high grade tumors have the potential to get out of hand rather quickly.  BCG is also effective against high grade \"T\" tumors, but not so much when they are low grade.  Bladder cancer has a nasty little habit of recurring;  when low grade bladder cancer comes back over and over, BCG is often tried.\n\nCIS is somewhat like a rash on the surface of the bladder.  It is diffuse and, therefore, cannot easily be removed as many of the papillary form of tumors can be.  BCG is an attenuated (modified) tuberculosis bacterium that was developed many many years ago as a vaccination for children against TB.  It is instilled into the bladder as a wash and its purpose is to stimulate, or activate, the immune system to reject the foreign cancer cells in the bladder lining.\n\nBCG does have some side effects, the most common being fatigue, urinary urgency, and bleeding.  These are usually short-lived and show that the immune system is being stimulated.  In many cases, such as mine, this keeps the cancer from returning.\n\nThe \"best practice\" protocol for CIS is for an initial 6 week series of BCG installations.  Then, a few months later, a \"maintenance\" regimen is started.  The exact timing of this can vary, but mine was to have BCG every three weeks every three months until two years had passed.  It has been shown that the maintenance protocol increases the effectiveness of the BCG significantly.\n\nYou absolutely want to follow your urologist's recommendations;  it does appear that they are \"right on\" for treatment of CIS.  You will also want to keep your appointments for re-checks scrupulously.  Like all bladder cancer, CIS can recur...the BCG is meant to help avoid that..but if not treated it can quickly spread.\n\nI hope that I have answered some of your questions, including those you posted below.

But I will jump in anyway.\n\nOthers have reported pain quite a while after a TURB, but it is not the usual thing.  By now I would think that your urologist would be trying to help you find out what is causing it.  Have the UTI's been confirmed by culturing the infective bacteria?  That would be important to confirm that it is indeed an infection, and to be sure that the antibiotic is appropriate for it.\n\nI am a little curious about the part of your path report:\n\n\"Benign urothelium with chronic nonspecific cystitis\"\n\nI had a similar comment on my first path report.  My urologist said that we needed to go back and look at that so he scheduled a second TURB, where he paid special attention to those areas that just looked \"irritated.\"  The second path report resulted in a diagnosis of CIS, which is high grade and required immediate treatment!  It is considered the best standard of care to do a second TURB if there is any question at all about the results of the first, and a second TURB increases the accuracy of the diagnosis significantly.  The first time, the urologist \"think\" he/she knows where to take biopsy samples, but during a second he has a much better idea of where special attention should be given.\n\nAre you being seen at a place that diagnoses and treats a lot of bladder cancer cases?  Many urologists do not see a lot of it and their expertise tends to run toward prostate issues.  Another reason to be sure you are with a urologist who specializes in bladder cancer is the mention of lamina propria invasion.  Was there any note that muscle tissue was included in the biopsy?  This means that the cancer has spread just below the surface of the bladder lining and you want to be SURE that it has not gone any deeper.  Has your urologist outlined a treatment plan?\n\nYou need to do two things:  Yes, the pain may well be \"bladder spasms\" but your doctor should be determining WHY this far out and giving you help other than just narcotic pain killers.  Second, you need to find out exactly what the situation is in your bladder....is there any involvement of the muscle?\n\nIf you do not get good answers to your questions, this might be a good time to investigate a second opinion at a major bladder cancer center.\nYou want to be sure that your diagnosis and treatment plan are at the highest level of medical practice.

I re-read what I wrote(above) and was relieved to see that I had said \"IMHO\" (in my humble opinion) since, indeed, it is only MY opinion.  I HAVE to chose my own doctors.    I have five physicians that I see regularly and only two of them are in the same PPO program.  I do not need prior approval for any medical appointment or procedure, as long as it is prescribed by a physician.\n\nHaving been on a medical school faculty (although I am not an MD ) I am not comfortable unless I have checked out a potential doctor's education, residency, post-graduate training, and certification.  Pretty picky!  Have a friend who moved to a different part of the country and had to chose a new insurance plan.  \"Everyone\" recommended Insurance XXXX since it was \"so reasonable.\"  She signed up and found herself in a PPO.  She had an accident her first week in her new residence, fell, and broke her foot. A month later she had over $4000 worth of bills since the hospital and doctor that her family rushed her to was not in her plan.  She later sent me a copy of the list of \"approved in-plan\" primary care docs and asked me to check them out and help her pick one.  Of the 12 on the list, NOT ONE WAS A US-TRAINED MD!  I do realize that this is an example of a pretty poor plan ....ie, \"cheap,\" and there are many much better.\n\nChoosing an insurance plan or supplement is a very personal decision.  I guess I would change my advice to \"be careful and research ALL the options\" and then pick the one that most meets your needs!  The friend I mentioned above is a very intelligent woman, yet she had no idea what a PPO (or even a Medicare Advantage) plan was.  She just signed up for a \"supplement\" and assumed it would pay her bills.\n\nI would hope that discussions such as ours would lead others to THINK about what they are buying in choosing insurance.  Surely one size does not fit all!\n\nSara Anne\t\t\t", "date": "2016-11-29T00:00:41+00:00", "topic": "Just found Out", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tHave you received the pathology report?

Your cancer has been there for a long time and a few more weeks will not change things!\n\nIf you are on Medicare and want the freedom to make your own decisions as to where to go for treatment, you need to find a traditional Medicare supplement with no limitations on your choice of physicians and hospitals.  Of course, this will probably be the most expensive, but IMHO it is worth it.  You do NOT want a PPO. Kaiser has a reputation for excellent care, BUT except in unusual circumstances it is within their own system and it is very difficult to go out of it.\n\nWithout knowing your exact diagnosis, it is difficult to make recommendations.

There was no muscle tissue in the sample, so the pathologist couldn't tell if the cancer had gone into the muscle, but since it would have to be in the lamina propria first, that is probably not a problem.\n\nI am a little surprised that the urolgist has prescribed BCG treatments.

I can remember when I was first suspected of having bladder cancer and the multitude of questions I had.\n\nAnother Forum poster had a similar question recently about what to expect from a TURB and here is how I answered him:\n\nThe TURB (transurethral resection of the bladder) is both a way to remove as much of the suspected tumor as possible and a way to obtain tissue to send to the pathologist for a complete diagnosis. It is done as an outpatient but under general anesthesia. After the TURB the urologist may have a pretty good idea of what you might be facing, but the complete picture will not be available until he and you get the pathologist's report....and this can take up to a week or so. Immediately after the TURB the urologist will probably wash the bladder with mitomycin, which is a chemo agent.

This test is helpful only when used with other types of diagnostic test. since it is so sensitive that it sometimes gives positive (ie, there are cancer cells present) when there really aren't.  Your doctor really needs to discuss with you what your test indicated.  It probably showed some abnormal cells, which is why he is scheduling a TURB.\n\nAs for symptoms of bladder cancer, they can vary from absolutely nothing, to microscopic blood in the urine, to very visible blood in the urine, or to symptoms which seem to be a urinary tract infection.\n\nI hope that this answers some of your questions.

He is lucky to have you as his advocate.  The usual treatment for non-invasive (early) bladder cancer is a TURB  (transurethral resection of the bladder) where the urologist removes the tumor while the patient is under very light general anesthesia.  Radiation is not routinely used in these cases and can cause additional problems.  The TURB procedure is usually done as an out-patient procedure and is not a difficult one, such as major surgery can be.  After the tumor is removed, it is sent to a pathologist for analysis.  Only after the pathologist's report is back can the doctors be absolutely sure what the stage and grade really is.\n\nIn cases of low grade, early bladder cancer, a TURB can be curative.  The patient will be monitored by a cystoscopy exam every three months for about two years.  If there is no sign that the cancer has returned, he will then go to every six month's monitoring.\n\nThe reason for the continual monitoring is that yes, bladder cancer does have a nasty habit of returning, so the monitoring allows it to be caught early if it does.  In many many cases it never does reappear.\n\nSara Anne\t\t\t", "date": "2016-08-08T15:41:24+00:00", "topic": "Elderly father with bladder cancer, stage 2", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tNot at all.

High grade means that it has the potential to spread, which is why BCG is almost always used to treat it ASAP.\nBCG can be very effective in the treatment of CIS.....that is the route that I took and I am fully healthy eight years out!\n\nYour urologist is correct in that the side effects do increase as the treatment goes on.  BCG is a modified tuberculosis bacterium that was developed many many years ago as a safe inoculation for children to try to prevent TB.  In bladder cancer it is used to stir up the immune system in the bladder lining so that it attacks any cancer cells that are present.  As the immune system gears up, your body will feel more side effects.  The usual are bleeding, urinary urgency, burning, and fatigue.  THESE SHOW THAT THE BCG IS WORKING!  While they can be annoying, these side effects are nothing compared to those that people who must have systemic chemotherapy go through.  As your treatment goes on, if the side effects become too much, the dose of BCG can be significantly reduced....as low as 10% of the initial dose in some cases.  By the time I was through with my initial 6 weeks of treatment, and the two years of maintenance treatment, I was down to 1/3 the initial dose.\n\nYou will do very well, I am sure.

It stimulates the immune response in the cells in the bladder lining to fight the intrusive cancer cells.  It is a relatively benign treatment.  It does have some side effects, which vary with each individual, but no where near what traditional chemotherapy causes.  The usual treatment schedule is once a week for 6 weeks.  Then, after several months off, every three months until two years have passed.\n\nThe usual side effects of BCG are fatigue, urinary urgency and discomfort for a day or so after the treatments, and sometimes other discomfort.

You will find a LOT about BCG here.  Especially under the topic Non-Invasive...at the very top of the discussions there are several long threads on BCG that we saved permanently there because so many of us have, or are, receiving it.\n\nFirst, take a deep breath.  It is very likely that there is nothing major wrong and the symptoms you are having are not uncommon.  BCG is meant to cause an immune response in the bladder lining, which causes it to shed all the cancer cells there.  This often results in a LOT of irritation on the bladder surface, which is probably the cause of your symptoms.  Several times my BCG treatments had to be delayed because I had \"BCG cystitis\" or irritation in the bladder.\nFatigue is a common side effect, as you will read.  The GOOD news is that these symptoms indicate that your body is taking up the challenge and that the BCG is causing immune responses in the bladder.\n\nIf the symptoms become too uncomfortable, it is possible for your doctor to reduce the dose significantly.  There have been studies which show that even 1/10 the initial dose is effective.  By the time I finished the entire two year regimen I was on 1/3 the initial dose.  Please discuss this with your urologist.\n\nSome patients find the treatments too uncomfortable to continue.  If, after a trial with a reduced dose, the discomfort is still too much to handle, you can, of course, stop the treatments.  You will still gain the advantage of the response that you are showing now.\n\nI went through the entire series, at a reduced dose, and have now been cancer-free for over 7 years.  I am so glad that I did this.  The results can be well worth it!\n\nBest of luck to you\n\nSara Anne\t\t\t", "date": "2015-10-25T11:27:29+00:00", "topic": "Post BCG", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tFirst, relax and take a deep breath.  BCG is an attenuated modified bacterium that was initially developed in the 1920's to inoculate children against TB.\nIt will not cause TB in anyone. It is extremely unlikely that you or anyone in your family are at any risk, unless, for example, they had an immune deficiency disease.  The precautions are there for basic hygiene.\n\nYes, even if you are on a septic system, I would not imagine that a few pieces of toilet paper would screw it up, so I would suggest she flush it for the six hours.\nAfter that time all BCG should be pretty well out of her system.  I used a maxi-pad for the afternoon after BCG administration, and wrapped it carefully before I threw it away.\n\nBCG can cause problems, for example, if a patient had an open wound in the bladder at the time of instillation.  That is why the urologist always checks for a UTI or blood in the urine first, and often postpones a treatment if any problems exist.  But this would be a case of the bacteria getting into the patient's blood stream.\n\nThousands of us have had BCG treatments and I know of no one whose family has had any problems.

MD Anderson is an excellent choice, BTW.\n\nThere is not much point in discussing the situation until you have the final diagnosis, because things can be different than they seem now.

During the initial TURB, the urologist is sort of \"guessing\" where to take samples from his visual inspection.  After the initial report is in, he has a much better idea of where questionable areas are and can ensure that he gets proper samples from those places, which include muscle tissue.\n\nUnfortunately, Univ of Virginia, while excellent in some areas of urology, is not noted for expertise in bladder cancer.  The same is true of Medical College of Virginia in Richmond.  Since your father will have to travel a bit anyway, it would be worth the effort to go to Johns Hopkins in Baltimore which has a superb reputation.

They are \"right on\" in recommending a second TURB.  Too often this is not done.  The first time the uro takes samples where he thinks the tumors are.  The second time, with results from the first go-round in hand, he has a much better idea of where the problem sites might be.  My diagnosis after the second TURB was quite a bit different.\n\nIf you feel that you really need a second opinion, Johns-Hopkins will do a review of the pathology (slides and diagnosis) by mail.  Besides Mayo, other top bladder cancer centers include Memorial Sloan Ksttering in NYC, USC in Los Angeles, and MD Anderson in Houston.\n\nPartial cystectomy is not often used in bladder cancer cases, because the entire bladder is at risk of recurring tumors.  It is occasionally used in a rare type of bladder cancer, adenocarcinoma.  I am not a physician, but I strongly doubt that it would ever be considered with the presence of CIS....which is sort of like a rash on the bladder lining.\n\nI do know that, should it come to cystectomy, it is not the end of the world.

The urologist goes in, again with a camera.  Since you will not feel any pain he can make a much more thorough examination and take samples of the suspicious places and remove any obvious tumors.  These are sent to a pathologist for examination...which can take a week or so.  ONLY AFTER THE REPORT COMES BACK FROM THE PATHOLOGIST WILL YOU, AND YOUR DOCTOR, know whether is is indeed cancer and if so, what kind it is.  They may put a wash of mitomycin in your bladder after the TURB to destroy any cancerous cells that might have been left.  I was able to return home after I woke from surgery.  Males sometimes leave with a catheter which stays for a couple of days.  You may have some discomfort, bleeding, and/or painful urination for a bit...or not.\n\nOnce the pathology report comes back and you have discussed the entire situation from the urologist you will have a better idea of what you are facing and what kind of treatments may be indicated.  Often the cancer is found very early and is of a low grade, or slow developing kind.  Treatment for that is usually a \"watch and wait\" and you return about every three months for a cystoscopy to be sure that it hasn't returned.  If it is high grade, there are outpatient treatments such as BCG to treat it.  If it has progressed into the bladder muscle or beyond, it is a whole different story, but it is much too early to think about that.   It is at this point, when you have all the information from the TURB and the path report, that you will need to do some serious thinking about your further course.  If you have full confidence in your doctor and have established a good working relationship, you may feel comfortable there...especially if the diagnosis is low grade.  If, on the other hand, it is high grade or worse you may well want to seek other opinions.  That would be the time.\n\nI know that, although I have given you a lot of information, it is a lot to \"swallow\" at one gulp.  Please ask us any questions you may have and we will try to explain.  We are not doctors...just people like yourself who have been where you are now.\n\nSara Anne\t\t\t", "date": "2015-03-02T01:34:56+00:00", "topic": "Second Opionion before Bioposy", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tIf the urologist recently removed the scar tissue from the earlier biopsy site, it is not surprising that it did not contain cancerous cells, since these were removed earlier.

Need I say that her story did NOT have a happy ending?\n\nThe urologist is doing exactly what he should be doing.  Very often during the first TURB he doesn't know exactly the extent of things. During the second, he has a much better idea of where additional samples need to be taken for pathology.\n\nUsually, when urologists discuss bladder cancer, they do not use the usual stages in the description.  It is either \"low grade\" (very slowly growing) or \"high grade\" (with rapidly dividing cells and more likely to spread quickly.)  They will also tell you if it is has invaded the lamina propera (the next layer in the bladder) or the muscle.  One reason for a second TURB is that the urologist may not have taken a deep enough sample to check these.\n\n\"Superficial\" is not really descriptive of how dangerous it may be.  This just means that, as of now, it appears to be growing out of the top layers of the bladder surface, either like a little mushroom or a rash, and it can still be high grade.\n\nDuring the TURB the urologist removes as much of the tumor as he can, but the primary purpose is to get samples to send for analysis by the pathologist.  Only when the pathology report comes back will he...and you...be sure what you are dealing with.  It is also probable that your urologist will do a wash of the bladder after the TURB...probably with Mitomycin A...just as a precaution.\n\nIf the tumor is low grade there probably will not be any more treatments right now.

Please remember that everyone is different.  BCG is usually NOT a big deal.  I would rather have it than go to the dentist.  And also remember that CIS is high grade and has a real potential to spread rather quickly.  BCG is nothing compared to the traditional chemotherapy that many other cancer patients experience.\n\nWhat is BCG like?  Using a very small catheter they basically wash your bladder with the BCG solution.  You try to hold it as long as you can...hopefully about 2 hours.  The BCG is intended to stimulate the immune system in the bladder lining so that it rejects the cancer cells.  I had CIS...did the usual 6 weeks of BCG and then the complete maintenance series and have been cancer-free for 6 years.  Believe me, it is worth it.\n\nI did not find the instillation process more than just slightly uncomfortable.  After the treatments, there are several hours of discomfort...burning, having to pee ALL THE TIME, passing blood clots.  Over the next several days I felt fatigue.  But it was nothing that interferred with my daily activities.  I drove myself to the treatments, about 20 minutes from home, and was able to make it to my bathroom before the \"fun\" started.\n\nMales may find the catheritization a bit more uncomfortable and the urologist usually uses numbing gel to help this.  The side effects are not usually too bad the first few times;  they do increase as the treatments continue...THIS IS GOOD...IT INDICATES THAT THE IMMUNE SYSTEM IS BEING STIRRED UP.\n\nAlso remember that people who have something to complain about are the ones whose posts appear most often.  For everyone with a complaint, there are many more who are doing just fine.\n\nYou do not want to fool with CIS!\n\nYou mentioned that you are having 3 BCG treatments?  The usual protocol is to have 6, each a week apart, and then about three months later a maintenance series where you get 3 weekly treatments every three months until 2 years have passed.\n\nGood Luck to you...and YOU CAN DO THIS!\n\nSara Anne\t\t\t", "date": "2015-01-27T18:13:27+00:00", "topic": "bcg worries ?!", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tTake a deep breath!  You will be fine.  BCG is the best treatment, particularly for high grade bladder cancer.  I was diagnosed with CIS a bit over 6 years ago, did the BCG and the BCG maintenance and am still cancer-free.  Was it worth it?  WHAT DO YOU THINK!!\n\nOf course, everyone is different in how they react.  I live about a 20 minute drive from my urologist's office and I drove myself there and back.  The first few hours after the treatment are not particularly fun...you may have some bleeding, you WILL have urgency and have to urinate OFTEN.  Don't plan to be far from the toilet!\n\nThe next day you should feel \"nearly\" normal.  May have some burning with urination, and maybe some fatigue.  I was always able to carry on as usual, but was aware that I wasn't really 100%.  Some people find the fatigue difficult.\n\nYou should be aware that the side effects tend to increase as the treatments continue.  This is because the BCG is causing your immune system to kick up, which is exactly what you want it to do.  If the side effects become too much for you, the dose can be reduced significantly and still be effective.\n\nWe tend to recommend second opinions here quite often.  In your case, it depends on several things.  Where are you being treated?  Are you comfortable with the doctor and his staff?  It sounds as if the treatment you are getting is \"right on\" for you case.  However, should the cancer reappear after you have finished the BCG treatments, it might be a good idea to seek a second opinion since you will have to consider multiple options at that point.  However, we will be optimistic and assume that it will NOT come back!\n\nBCG is not particularly fun, but it is a heck of a lot better than the chemotherapy that many cancer patients require.

The simplest is where the bladder is removed and the urine is routed through an exit in the abdomen and into an exterior bag.  The second uses a piece of the bowel to form a new \"bladder\" where the urine collects inside the body.

I remember when I was first diagnosed and I came home and thought \"now I know what I am going to die from.\"\nWell, I didn't and I won't!!\n\nYou won't know exactly what you are facing until the pathology report comes back after the TURB.  Many bladder cancers are \"low grade\" which means that they do not have a high probability of spreading rapidly.  As far as the diagnosis in the ER goes, even some doctors don't realize that WOMEN can get bladder cancer so it is often a long time from the appearance of symptoms to a diagnosis.\n\nAs for bladder removal, yes, it IS a cure.  But it is usually not considered if the tumor is low grade and shows no signs of spreading.  There are other ways to treat it...frequent cystoscopy, and careful watching.  The bad thing about low grade bladder cancer is that it tends to come back.  If it is high grade, but shows no signs of spreading, there are still ways of treating it without removing the bladder.  IF it comes to bladder removal, even that is not the end of the world.  Many people ....many members of this Forum...are living full and active lives without their bladder.\n\nAs I said at first, please don't panic.  I know that is hard!!!

I HOPE\nthat now that you have finished the six initial treatments, your urologist has scheduled you for a series of maintenance treatments.  These have been shown to increase the effectiveness of BCG significantly.  There are other drugs that are used, such as Mitomycin C, but they are not as effective and are usually used when, for some reason, BCG cannot.\n\nDon't agonize over the statistics.  You can find statistics all over the map on effectiveness.  I have seen some that are better than the 60% you quote, and maintenance treatments improve on those significantly.\n\nFinally, BE SURE TO KEEP YOUR CYSTOSCOPY APPOINTMENTS.  If there should be recurrences, you want them found early.  It is much premature to be overly worried about bladder removal (easy for her to say!) because the odds are that it won't happen.

So while that can be a sign of cancer, it is not always present.\n\nThe urologist will probably do an exam in his office...a cystoscopy...where he will examine the inside of the bladder with a tiny camera.  However, since a mass was seen on the CT he may skip this step and go directly to a TURB (transurethral biopsy of the bladder.)  This is usually an outpatient procedure (although some patients do stay overnight) where the urologist examines the bladder lining while you are under general anesthesia, removes the tumor if possible, and takes samples to send to the pathologist for examination.  The report from the pathologist will provide the definitive information ...if it IS indeed cancer, what type, and what grade and stage it is.  Only then will the urologist and you be able to decide on an appropriate treatment regimen.\n\nIf the tumor is bladder cancer, and is LOW GRADE, it is possible that the recommendation will be for no treatment, but to continue to monitor you with cystoscopy exams every three months.  One of the characteristics of bladder cancer is that it tends to return, so it is important to have these exams!\n\nIf the tumor is HIGH GRADE (likely to spread) or has already spread into the lining of the bladder or into the muscle, the treatment options are different and vary according to what the pathologist reports.\n\nUnfortunately, you cannot know the answers to any of these questions until the pathology report is done.

I think I responded to your questions about BCG treatment above, so I will just add a little more on other issues.\n\nInterstitial cystitis is one of those things that doctors really do not know the cause of and (in my opinion) often use it to cover things when they don't quite know what is going on!!!     AND it is many times more likely to be diagnosed in women.  My suspicion is that CIS was causing all the symptoms from the beginning.  I had been diagnosed with recurrent urinary tract infections for over a year (and interstitial cystitis was mentioned, but not seriously, as a possibility).  Of course, no one bothered to take a culture!  When I finally saw a urologist, and cultures of urine were taken...guess what?  NO BACTERIA.  That is when CIS was finally diagnosed, and my urologist said that it could explain all the symptoms.\n\nI am amazed that your husband's uro said it could be CIS and didn't do anything.  Immediately after I was finally diagnosed we began BCG.  My uro even had me cancel an imminent trip of three weeks to China since he said that CIS is high grade and MUST be treated asap.\n\nThis is not something to be treated lightly, and it needs to be taken care of as soon as possible.  I am not really familiar with the medical system in NZ (but I think you have a wonderful, beautiful country!) but it appears that BCG is the treatment of choice there also.\n\nAnd no, there are no permanent side effects to BCG (unless you are one of those rare people who have an unusual reaction to it) EXCEPT that it reduces the incidence of CIS by up to 70%.  I am now five years out from my initial diagnosis, and completely normal (well, urologically speaking.)

You and your husband have a steep learning curve ahead.  First, with something as important as cystectomy (bladder removal) it is usually a very good idea to get a second opinion.  There are a number of options for pre-treatment, the type of diversion, and the after-surgery course. Pt is important to be sure that you are getting absolutely the best medical advice possible.  In fact, my urologist told me that if we every faced this (which so far we haven't) that he would INSIST on my getting a second opinion.\n\nDid the urologist explain why he felt that the external bag was the best option?  Often if people are quite elderly or have serious other medical conditions, this is the best option.  In other cases, the patient has a choice.\n\nWhatever diversion your husband decides on, he needs to find a urological surgeon who does  a great many of these each year.  Research has shown that the more a physician does, the better his outcome record is.\n\nIf you can seek a second opinion and an evaluation of your husband's case, that is what you should seriously consider before going any further.  His current doctor should have no problem with this...it is good medical practice.  The best result of a second opinion is that it will confirm the initial diagnosis and recommendations.  It might provide additional options for you to consider.  And, if it turns out that the current situation is not the best, you need to know this NOW rather than later.\n\nIf you are interested in a second opinion, and are wondering where to go for one, let us know where you are located and some of our members may have suggestions for a good place near you.\n\nWishing you and your husband the best of luck/\n\nSara Anne\t\t\t", "date": "2013-10-20T20:07:58+00:00", "topic": "New to Bladder Cancer", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tOuch.

Takes about 10 minutes and is no big deal.\n\nA TURB takes several hours (including anesthesia and reoovery) and may, or may not, require a catheter.\n\nBoth procedures can be LIFE-SAVING and are well worth any minor discomfort involved.

If the symptoms become too uncomfortable, your urologist can reduce the dose even down to 10% of the starting dose.  By the time I finished my maintenance series, I was down to 1/3 dose.  These reduced doses are just as effective.  Usually at first the effects are very minimal, but as your body reacts to the drug (as it is supposed to do) they can increase.\n\nYour urologist will be especially careful NOT to give you a treatment if your bladder is especially irritated or if you have any signs of infection.  They always do a urinalysis prior to treatment.  You are very unlikely to have any truly serious side effects.\n\nIn reality, BCG is very do-able.

I assume that you had BCG instillations after your diagnosis.  This works very well for some types of bladder cancer and is not so effective for others.  The recommended protocol is to have six treatments a week apart, and then maintenance treatments about every three months for up to several years.  The statistics show that the chance of recurrence is MUCH less than with just the one series, assuming the type of bladder cancer you have is sensitive to this.\n\nThe recommended treatment also has an exam (cystoscopy) every three months for two years, before transitioning to every six months.\n\nYour urologist will do cytology (checking for abnormal cells OR infections) on your urine with every exam.  Not all do a FISH test each time if the other tests are negative.  Cytology tests are not perfect, and can give both false positive results and false negative results on occasion.  This is why doctors need to use all the other tests AND their own experience.\n\nWe always recommend that patients seek a second opinion at a center that treats LOTS of bladder cancer, since not all urologists are as familiar with the current practice in this area.  The very BEST thing that would happen is that the cancer center would tell you that your doctor has everything well in hand and that you are receiving the very best level of treatment.

They are much less than if you had to undergo systemic chemotherapy as is necessary with invasive cancers.  BCG is instilled directly into the bladder and not into the body as a whole.  You try to keep it there for about 2 hours.  Since the purpose of BCG is to stimulate the immune system so that your bladder rejects the tumor cells, it does take a while to work.  At first you feel minimal side effects once the first half day or so is over.  As you continue to have BCG treatments the side effects probably increase, and this does indicate that your immune system is \"kicking in.\"  The most common side effects are urinary urgency (as if you had a bladder infection), bleeding when you urinate, and fatigue.  Most of us plan to take the day of instillation off work but are able to return the next day (especially if a bathroom is nearby!)  If the side effects become intolerable, it is possible for the urologist to use a reduced dose.  Your experience may be different from what I described, which is sort of the typical reaction.\n\nThose of us who have CIS should be truly grateful to have BCG since it has a very good record with CIS.\n\nSara Anne\t\t\t", "date": "2019-01-10T02:36:01+00:00", "topic": "10 years cancer free", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tHi there, Mareens!\n\nJust a few words about second TURBs.  The purpose of a TURB is twofold.  The first is to obtain tissue samples to be sent to the pathology lab so that an exact diagnosis can be made.  The second is to remove any solid tumors.  Unfortunately CIS does not present as a solid tumor  but instead is more like a rash on the surface of the bladder lining.\n\nA second TURB  is indicated if there is any uncertainty about a diagnosis .   My situation is a good example   The first TURB  showed that I had papillary carcinoma which is like little mushrooms growing up from the bladder lining and these were removed.   The pathology report indicated that these were low-grade bladder cancer but the report also said that there were areas of irritation with some abnormal cells .   Therefore my urologist recommended a second TURB to try to determine what this might be.   During the second TURB he paid special attention to the area where the so-called irritation was found and took multiple samples which were found to be CIS which as you know is high grade.   I then had BCG treatments similar to Nancy and have been cancer free for almost 11 years .\n\nWhile a TURB can remove something like papillary tumors it cannot remove CIS so your doctor is correct.  If the cancer is still noninvasive BCG would be the most likely recommended treatment.\nFrom your description it sounds as if your doctors are doing exactly what is done here in the US.\n\nThere are several different protocols used for BCG administration here .   One of the most common in the one that I had which was six weeks of BCG once a week followed by a recovery period of several months and then maintenance BCG treatments once a week for three weeks every two months or so for a period of two years .   Some doctors use a different schedule for the maintenance treatments and they all seem to be similarly effective.   I didn\u2019t do anything special like diet or supplements but just lived a normal relatively healthy life .\n\nI always recommend a second opinion at a center like MD Anderson if there is a problem with a diagnosis or a complicated case or an on usual form of bladder cancer.   However in your case it appears that your doctors are doing exactly what would be recommended here\n\nWishing you all the best\n\nSara Anne\t\t\t", "date": "2019-01-10T02:36:01+00:00", "topic": "10 years cancer free", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tHi,  Ange.   I will just provide some anecdotal evidence about the various options you are facing\n\nThe ileal conduit is the simplest surgery and takes the least time .   As you know urine iis collected in a bag outside the body which is usually located on the lower abdomen .   Sometimes people have difficulty before they find the exact bag that fits their needs but many supply companies will give you free samples of multiple types .   It is possible to wear clothes so that no one knows that you have such a device\n\nAnother option is called the Indiana pouch    In this case a small portion of your intestine is used to make a bag that holds urine.   This is inside your body and it is connected to a valve either in or near your bellybutton.  About  every four hours or so you drain the pouch by placing a catheter through the valve.   In this case there is nothing on the outside of your body .\n\nThe third option, the neobladders, uses an internal pouch also constructed from intestine which is hooked up to the original \u201cplumbing \u201c and, under ideal circumstances you urinate the normal way.  This is the most complicated and longist surgery.   It works better in males than females because of differences in our anatomy .   While  some women have had successfully had neobladders, many are either incontinent or hypercontinent.\n\nAs Alan mentioned the expertise of the surgeon can make all the difference so you need to be sure that your doctor performs many of the type of surgery that you want .   Many times a urologist may be only familiar with one procedure so that is the one that he or she recommends .  Also as  Alan has mentioned people tend to get used to whatever diversion they choose and are quite happy no matter which one they have.\n\nSara Anne\t\t\t", "date": "2019-04-03T22:17:26+00:00", "topic": "Ilead conduit", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tAs has been pointed out, we are all individuals and what works for one will not work for another.

Here is what I said about the possible BCG shortage and its effect on your treatment:\n\n\"First of all, BCG is obtained by the doctor's office, and not via Express Scripts or any outside pharmacy. There are other BCG preparations for other uses which is probably what Express Scripts listed. For bladder cancer it is administered via a very small catheter, much much smaller than any that is used for cystoscopy, for instance. It takes just a few minutes. You go in, they provide the BCG. It doesn't come from somewhere else with your name on it.\n\nThere is currently a shortage of BCG and this has been a recurring problem. There is only one supplier (a subsidiary of Merck) and since BCG is a \"biological\" preparation, made from bacteria, sometimes the bacteria do not cooperate and they need to start all over. This is similar to problems that are seen with vaccines....for example, currently vaccine production cannot keep up with the demand for the new shingles vaccine.\"\n\nIt appears that the shortage is not as bad as predicted, and your doctor has been able to obtain it.\n\nYou are receiving BCG because CIS (carcinoma in situ) is high grade and needs immediate attention.  There is a lot on BCG on this Forum....just go to the \"Search\" button at the top right of this page and search for it.  The most common side effect is fatigue, with urgency and burning when urinating also common.

If there is suspicion of a bladder tumor you will be scheduled for a TURB (transurethral resection of the bladder) which is sort of cystoscopy under mild general anesthesia.  As much of any tumor as can will be removed and it and samples of the surrounding tissue will be sent to a pathology lab for analysis.

You have some really good questions.\n\nYou mentioned that your father\u2019s diagnosis was \u201c high grade.\u201d  Did the pathology report mention carcinoma in situ (CIS?).  CIS is always high grade and BCG is the treatment of choice for it and high grade papillary bladder cancer.  CIS appears like a rash on the bladder lining and would be difficult to remove completely during a TURB.\n\nOften a second TURB is done if there is any uncertainty about the diagnosis such as not having enough surrounding tissue in the sample to determine if there has been any involvement of the muscle.   In my case the pathology came back low grade with some areas of undefined irritation   The urologist went back and did a second TURB paying special attention to the areas under question and the diagnoses thern came back carcinoma in situ which was a much different situation than the initial report indicated.\n\nIf his current urologist has any indication that tumor tissue was left behind or that the staging was not adequate of course he should do a second TURB.  It is a judgment call on the part of the urologist and since a TURB  is done under general anesthetic it is not something that is done without a good reason.  If your father is otherwise happy with the initial doctor, I wold have a frank talk with him about this before he makes a decision.  Ask him about the need for a second TURB.\n\nThe results of the urine cytology tests are something else.  Urine cytology is a diagnostic aid but has some problems. It has the unfortunate reputation for giving false positive results indicating the presence of cancer when there is none.  Since your father  had just had a TURB\nit is possible that there are damaged cells present which are showing up on the cytology as malignant.  Cytology results are never used in isolation to make a diagnosis.\n\nThis is a decision that your father is going to have to decide once he has all the information.\n\nLet us know what he decides!\n\nSara Anne\t\t\t", "date": "2018-12-02T03:24:50+00:00", "topic": "2nd TURBT for non invasive high grade bladder cancer", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tJim, an elevated sed rate is one of those completely vague lab results that most often have no explanation.

Was it low grade?  High grade?  CIS (carcinoma in situ?)\nThat is what determines what the treatment post-TURB should be.\n\nThe purpose of one treatment of mitomycin and six instillations of mitomycin or something else are different.  The\none dose of mitomycin after the TURB is just in case there are very small amounts of cancer left or against the possibility that the TURB might have distributed a few cells.  IF the diagnosis is high grade or CIS, once the bladder has healed, intravesical therapy (six doses) is used.  However, the drug of choice for this is BCG, not mitomycin.\nIF a patient cannot tolerate BCG, mitomycin is sometimes used as a second choice but it is not as effective as BCG.\nA few years ago there was a shortage of BCG and for several months it was not available and so mitomycin was used instead.\n\nThe current standard of care for high grade non-invasive bladder cancer is 6 treatments of BCG, one per week for six weeks.  If the bladder remains clear most urologists recommend at least two years of maintenance treatments with BCG.  This has been shown to reduce recurrences by as much at 70%.\n\nI agree with Alan....I would want to know WHY your urologist is not using BCG.

CIS is a bit like a rash on the surface of the bladder.  Unless samples are analyzed by the pathology lab the urologist cannot tell if it is even cancer instead of another type of inflammation.\n\nIf the pathology report indicates that the situation is indeed CIS or another high grade cancer then BCG is the current standard for treatment.  If it is NOT CIS or high grade BCG would not be indicated.\n\nThere is nothing new in this.  The usual sequence is that the urologist does cystoscopy and sees that there is apparently something abnormal.  He then does a TURB under general anesthesia and cuts out small samples for analysis.  Only after a review of the pathology report will he really know a.  Is it cancer?  b.  Is it CIS or high grade?  c.  Is it still noninvasive?  Often there are still questions and a second TURB is necessary before a treatment plan is determined.\n\nIf the diagnosis is Cis and it is noninvasive then BCG is the treatment of choice.\n\nThe above describes what would be done by any competent urologist.

Will try to answer ....please remember that we are not doctors, and are just giving you a layman's opinion, but from someone who has heard a lot about bladder cancer.\n\nYour initial biopsy report indicates that as you noted the diagnosis from the sample presented was low grade papillary urothelial bladder cancer.  Papillary means that it grows sort of like a mushroom up from the bladder lining.  Urothelial cells line the bladder and this is the most common type of bladder cancer.  The pathology does say that no muscle tissue was observed in the sample, which means that the pathologist was unable to tell if the tumor extended into the muscle or not.  The cystitis cystica indicates that there were areas of irritation also present. The COMMENT section is pretty standard...the reading was double checked by another pathologist...routine procedure.  All of this is probably what you already know.\n\nAs you probably also know one of the \"dirty little secrets\" of low grade bladder cancer is that it DOES tend to come back and it can come back as a high grade form.  Any time a tumor is seen it does need to be removed and biopsied.  For the urologist to suggest anything else would be gross malpractice.  Why are you afraid of a TURB?\nYou have done that before...it is really minor surgery, done with twilight anesthesia and usually as an outpatient.  I do understand that it is a bit more uncomfortable for males, but no big deal.  And it is absolutely essential to be sure that the cancer has not progressed.\n\nTo get specific about your questions:\nIs a PAPILLARY UROTHELIAL NEOPLASM, LOW GRADE, NONINVASIVE biopsy really cancer?\nI don't know where you read that this is not really cancer.  It IS really cancer and has the potential to become high grade as well as to spread (low grade means that is isn't spreading rapidly...not that it is not growing.)  It is not now invasive but if left long enough it certainly can be.\n\nIs the papillary lesion in my prostatic urethra likely to be the same biopsy as my bladder was?\nOnly a biopsy will tell.\n\nIs the risk that the papillary lesion is going to be something harmful to me any higher than going under anesthesia for a surgical procedure?\nAbsolutely.  And the anesthesia used for a TURB is NOT the type used for an appendectomy!  It is just enough to put you under so that you do not feel the small cuts made for the biopsy.\n\nAre there any blood, urine or semen test markers that are indicators of Urology cancer?\nThere are several urine tests for cancerous cells in the urine. The one most mentioned in the FISH test. However, these are useful only in conjunction with pathology and are not entirely accurate, sometimes giving false positive results.\n\nIn summary, you do need to have the TURB and also be scrupulous about keeping your 3 month appointments so that any recurrence can be handled immediately before it can become worse.\n\nThere are lots of us living full lives with this disease and you will too!!\n\nSara Anne\t\t\t", "date": "2018-04-23T23:14:35+00:00", "topic": "Is Surgery the Only Path", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tIf all the cancerous cells are removed before they have had a chance to move into other locations, it is very possible to be \u201ccured.\u201d  Cells which are already malignant do not, however, \u201cunmutate.\u201d\nBladder  cancer often recurs probably because whatever caused the cells to become unstable made other cells more likely to be unstable also.

Sometimes when no muscle is present in the biopsy samples it is necessary to do a second TURB to make sure.\n\nAs for the diet, that is for you to decide.  IMHO, since it took years for whatever changes caused the cells in your bladder lining to become unstable and turn cancerous, it is a bit of a stretch to assume that diet will have any effect now.

Cystoscopy involves the urologist using a very small camera to look inside the bladder, while TURB (transurethral resection of the bladder) is done under anesthetic so that biopsy sample can be removed and sent to the pathologist for analysis.  It is NOT uncommon for bleeding to occur after a TURB....after all, pieces of the bladder were cut out.  And an anti-coagulant would increase the odds of this.\n\nWe are not doctors here, just patients and families of patients like yourself.  Your questions about anticoagulant use need to be addressed with your urologist asap since any changes would need to be made quite a while before further treatment.\n\nAs for BCG, first the urologist always checks urine prior to instillation.  If there is any blood or infection present, they will not administer BCG until it is resolved.  And since in your case the tumors have returned, a totally new series of 6 BCG instillations would be indicated;  maintenance (3 treatments every three months) is used when there is no evidence of a return, to insure that it does not come back.\n\nIt is important for you to discuss the situation with regard to your anticoagulant use with your urologist.  In addition, if the side effects of the BCG are too much to bear, the dose can be reduced significantly with no apparent loss of effectiveness.

Sometimes a severe infection or other irritation can cause something like this.\n\nThe usual procedure in a case like this is to do a second TURB (biopsy) a month or so later with special attention paid to getting really good samples of the areas that are atypical.  The first time the urologist is sort of in the dark but the second he knows where to concentrate his efforts and this usually results in a proper diagnosis.

Your urologist is doing the appropriate treatment for high grade, because I suspect that the installation will be BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) which is the treatment of choice in such cases.  It is also possible, although not as likely, that he might be using Mitomycin.\n\nSince bladder cancer such as yours is still confined to the bladder, it is possible to treat it very successfully without subjecting the entire body to the type of chemo used for other, systemic cancers.\n\nIf you will be receiving BCG, you will find LOTS of information in this forum about it.  Usually it is instilled once a week for 6 weeks.  Then there is a waiting period to allow the bladder lining to heal;  your doctor will then examine the bladder to see how things are going.  Most likely you will then have the treatment once a week for three weeks, every few months, for a total of about 2 years.  These maintenance treatments have been shown to increase the effectiveness of BCG significantly.\n\nThere are side effects with BCG.  You may have cramping, bleeding, and fatigue, but this usually lasts only for the day of instillation and maybe into the next.  These side effects show that the treatment is WORKING!!  If they become too uncomfortable, the doctor can reduce the dose significantly without  reducing the effectiveness.  This treatment is certainly better than traditional chemo!!\n\nI was diagnosed with high grade CIS four years ago.

The blood clots are a normal reaction as the bladder is sloughing off a bit of the lining....and maybe some cancer cells also.

I kept having \"Urinary Tract Infections\", over and over and over, and my internist kept prescribing antibiotics again, and again, and again.  I was overdue for my pap smear and went to a new practice, recommended by a friend, where I was seen by a wonderful nurse practitioner.  I happened to mention the recurrent \"UTIs\" and she firmly told me that, if you have more than three UTIs in a year, you go to a urologist.  She recommended a practice nearby, and even told me which of the five urologists there to avoid!!!\n\nSure enough, a few weeks later, another \"UTI\" had me calling the urology practice, where I took \"potluck\" from the recommended doctors.  Here LUCK stepped in, and I met my urologist, Dr. Janoff, who had trained with the best, was young and whose personality fit mine perfectly.  First, he ascertained that I did NOT have a UTI even though I was symptomatic.  Cystoscopy showed a lesion in the bladder.  TURB led to a diagnosis of low-grade papillary carcinoma, but Dr. Janoff had some questions about some \"irritated\" areas of the bladder.  A few weeks later, a second TURB confirmed his suspicions of CIS.\n\nNow, after a complete course plus maintenance of BCG (at continually lower doses), I am still doing great.  All my horrible \"UTI\" symptoms are gone and I recently graduated to 6 month exam intervals!\n\nLessons to be learned from my experience?  Repeated symptoms of urinary tract infections are NOT to be ignored.  This was the only symptom I had....NEVER had any blood in the urine, microscopic or otherwise.  Find a urologist who is an expert in bladder cancer (here I just had good luck...REALLY good luck).\nMany urologists see primarily men with prostate issues...or, if they do specialize in women, it is for typical incontinence problems.  To find someone really GOOD in bladder cancer treatment is VERY IMPORTANT.\n\nI came to this site, knowing nothing about bladder cancer...in fact, I often joke, that I never even knew I HAD a bladder!  At first, of course, panic set in ...I kept telling myself that at least, now I knew what I would die of!  This site provided so much information...it took several tries before I was able to digest most of it.  But it was the people here who made a big difference.

Some are very slow growing and might just sit around causing minor problems for years without spreading.  These are considered \"non-aggressive.\"  Then there are some that have the potential to spread rapidly.  These can advance into the lymph nodes, the kidneys, and elsewhere in the body.  These are called \"aggressive\" and include CIS (carcinoma in situ) and some of the papillary tumors.  When the sample of the tumor is sent to the pathologist, he can determine by looking at the cells of the tumor if it is aggressive or not.\n\n\"Invasive\" refers to how far the tumor has progressed AT THE PRESENT TIME.  If you are fortunate, an aggressive tumor can be found early, while it is still non-invasive.  If it had not been found for another year, for example, it might have become invasive.\n\nYour husband is extremely lucky to have been diagnosed while his tumor was still non-invasive.  But, since it apparently is an aggressive type of cancer, it is important to keep on top o9f it.  It sounds as if your urologist is doing the right things.  A second TURB helps to be sure that the diagnosis is correct.  And it also appears that the urologist is going to have your husband treated with BCG.  There is a lot of information on BCG elsewhere on this web-site.\n\nOne thing about bladder cancer is that it has a tendency to return.  BCG treatment is one way to try to keep it from coming back.\n\nKeep asking your questions and, in a little while, you will be an expert!!!

BCG is usually used when it keeps recurring...multiple times...or if you have CIS  \"carcinoma in situ.\"\n\nSince he took a biopsy sample and removed the tumor there was injury to your bladder.  It may take a week or so to heal before the blood specks disappear.\n\nAgain, I urge you to read all the background material on this web site.  After that, there are lots of really knowledgeable people on this list to answer your questions and offer support.\n\nI showed up here, like you, in January.

You should pick one who does many of the procedures a year.....25 to 35 if possible.  We have seen many examples where a patient is told that the ileal conduit is the only diversion appropriate for that patient, when the reality is that this is the only one that surgeon is competent to do!!

I know multiple people who have this diversion and have had no unexpected problems.

The first is papillary carcinoma, in which the tumors form stalk-like shapes, sort of like mushrooms, growing out of the bladder lining.  These can be either low grade (slow growing) or high grade (rapidly growing and dividing.)  CIS form like a rash on the bladder lining.  Since it is not a discrete tumor it cannot be removed during a TURB.  Unlike breast cancer, for example, where CIS is not really considered serious CIS in the bladder is ALWAYS high grade and fast growing and spreading.  It is totally different in all respects from the kind found in the breast.

I would get rid of the bladder as fast as I could.  IMHO too many people seem to be fonder of their bladder than their life!  And I would want it gone before it could spread.\n\nRadiation has not been the most successful treatment for bladder cancer and the effects of radiation can make subsequent surgeries much more difficult.  As for chemo, it is often used PRIOR to a radical cystectomy to reduce the tumor load before surgery.  It is also used AFTER radical cystectomy in the hope that any stray cancer will be caught before it spreads.

With all the research you have done, I assume you have found this link\n\nmy.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/urinary-reconstruction-and-diversion\n\nIMHO it is the best summary discussion of the various diversion types.\n\nThe answers to a lot of the questions which you have posed, however, are \"it depends.\"  It is possible to have any of the diversions and have minimal issues.  It is also possible to have major problems after any of them.  A lot depends on the skill of the surgeon.  You want to have a surgeon who does MANY of the type that you hope to have.  Five or ten a year is NOT a lot.  You want someone who has done hundreds and has already run into the problems that come up.  A lot of urologists tout the DaVinci device...which does robotic surgery so that the incisions are much smaller than with conventional surgery.  IF you have a surgeon who is very experienced with robotic surgery, that is great.  If he/she was taught by a salesman from the manufacturer, not so much (and believe me, that is how it is sometimes done).  I have a urologist-friend who spent a year and a half at the Cleveland Clinic in an advanced fellowship to learn the technique.  Bottom line...I would rather have traditional surgery than robotic with someone who is not EXPERIENCED.  And it goes without saying, I would want traditional surgery with a very experienced surgeon also.\n\nOf course you will discuss these issues with your surgeon candidates.  How candid they are in their discussion would be another major factor in a choice both of surgeon and diversion.\n\nAnother major factor is the health and determination of the patient.  If you are in good health other than the bladder cancer and are someone who can handle a totally new situation and the challenges it faces, you might be a good candidate for a neobladder.  If you discourage easily, probably not.\n\nI am sure that several others will chime in on this subject.  I have NOT had to have a radical cystectomy, but know lots of people who have and have listened to a lot of their comments.\n\nWishing you all the best....\n\nSara Anne\t\t\t", "date": "2017-03-05T19:29:32+00:00", "topic": "Bladder cancer surgery decision criteria?", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tI don't know of any such list....you need to ask these questions of the urologist who is suggesting the surgery.\n\nIf you let us know where you are located, geographically, someone on the Forum may have suggestions as to places near you for a second opinion if you are not satisfied with your current situation.\n\nSara Anne\t\t\t", "date": "2016-01-30T15:02:18+00:00", "topic": "facing a radicl cystectomy and terrified", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tRoger, you will do fine with this!!

However, I would want to be at a place and with a doctor who does LOTS of these...at least 100 or more a year.  Any less and the doctor is still practicing.  The success of the surgery is at least 80-90% dependent on the skill of the surgeon.\n\nIt also depends on the situation that he finds when he gets inside.  Sometimes a patient goes into surgery expecting a neobladder and comes out with an ileal conduit since the position of the tumor made that impossible.\n\nAs to whether you have your surgery (no matter what kind) done robotically or conventionally is, again, immaterial.  What counts is the EXPERTISE of the surgeon and the NUMBER he has done with that particular method.\n\nYou wouldn't take your brand new Maserati into a mechanic who only does diesel trucks, would you?

For example, you may say \"We understand that it is important to have a surgeon who does a large number of these surgeries...How many do you do a year?\" Also ask what diversions the surgeon uses  (a general urologist who does not specialize in bladder cancer often is only competent to do the simplest, the ileal conduit.)

Medical care is a service for which you pay, and it is your responsibility to \"check it out.\"\n\nThe \"latest\" thing in bladder surgery is the robotic or da Vinci device where the surgeon uses a remote device that minimizes the extent of the open exposure during surgery.  This can be an advantage, BUT again, it is the experience of the surgeon, not the device used, that makes a difference.  Since the procedure is relatively new, it is again critical that the surgeon have a lot of experience with it.

Results of this type of research can lead to applications in many forms of cancer.\n\nSara Anne\t\t\t", "date": "2013-10-02T15:11:11+00:00", "topic": "Plasma Cytoid", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tWell, you certainly came up with a rare one!

This is GOOD news!  From your post, it appears that your cancer is NOT invasive....your path report states\n\"2. Muscularis Propria is represented and is uninvolved by Tumor\"\n\nHowever, your diagnosis was \"high grade.\"  I wonder if CIS (carcinoma in situ) was present?  Your urologist is doing the appropriate treatment for high grade, because I suspect that the installation will be BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) which is the treatment of choice in such cases.  It is also possible, although not as likely, that he might be using Mitomycin.\n\nSince bladder cancer such as yours is still confined to the bladder, it is possible to treat it very successfully without subjecting the entire body to the type of chemo used for other, systemic cancers.\n\nIf you will be receiving BCG, you will find LOTS of information in this forum about it.  Usually it is instilled once a week for 6 weeks.  Then there is a waiting period to allow the bladder lining to heal;  your doctor will then examine the bladder to see how things are going.  Most likely you will then have the treatment once a week for three weeks, every few months, for a total of about 2 years.  These maintenance treatments have been shown to increase the effectiveness of BCG significantly.\n\nThere are side effects with BCG.  You may have cramping, bleeding, and fatigue, but this usually lasts only for the day of instillation and maybe into the next.  These side effects show that the treatment is WORKING!!  If they become too uncomfortable, the doctor can reduce the dose significantly without  reducing the effectiveness.  This treatment is certainly better than traditional chemo!!\n\nI was diagnosed with high grade CIS four years ago.  Had BCG treatments (down to 1/3 dose at the end) and am still cancer-free!!\n\nI may have overwhelmed you with information, but want to assure you that this is very do-able!

What Mike and I have been saying is that probably the questions you have now can be answered where you are.\n\nThe delay in chemo because of a low blood count would be standard no matter where you are.  Time is NOT being wasted;  obviously the chemo is having an effect, as evidenced by the low blood counts.  When these come back up to acceptable levels, the chemo will continue and you will be right on track.  To go ahead with treatment when the blood counts are low would be dangerous indeed.  And stopping chemo to go somewhere else WOULD waste time right now.\n\nIf, after the chemo is completed, you still feel that your husband is not getting the correct treatment, that would be the time for a second (third?) opinion.\nMayo would probably be the best place;  you would want to go where they have a lot of expertise in treating invasive bladder cancer...not just cancer in general.\n\nPlease hang in there for now.

The treatment that your husband is getting is exactly what should be recommended for his condition.

If a patient's blood counts drop, it would be malpractice to give more chemo until they have had a chance to rebound.  This often happens, and, when they have recovered, the treatments will continue.  Others may chime in here, but I know that there are several people on this Forum who have done this, had to wait because of low blood counts, and then continued successfully.\n\nHaving said that I didn't think you needed a second opinion, I think you do need to get some communication going with his doctors.

I assume that your diagnosis was high grade and that is why you received BCG in 2014?  The current standard of care recommends an initial 6 weeks of BCG, and after an \"all clear\" a program of maintenance BCG every three months for up to two years.  This has been shown to significantly increase the effectiveness of the BCG.  I wonder why you didn't have maintenance BCG back then?\n\nMany, many of us here on the Forum have had this or a similar sequence.  I was diagnosed with high grade (CIS) in 2008 and had BCG and BCG maintenance then.  I have now been cancer-free for over 10 years.  I had a lot of bladder issues with burning and urgency that my urologist said were due to the CIS.  Yes, the BCG was not a fun time, and as the side-effects increased (which indicates that the immune system is \"kicking up\" which is what you WANT to happen) we decreased the dose.  I was on 1/3 the original dose by the time I finished (it is possible to reduce it, if necessary, to 1/10th.)  AND once the treatments were over my symptoms of urgency and burning were gone also.\n\nIn cases of high grade bladder cancer BCG can be life-saving.

The definitive diagnosis will be made after the TURB\n(transurethral resection of the bladder), or, as you referred to it, \"scraping.\"  Rather than scraping, the uro will take biopsy samples from various suspicious areas and send them to a pathologist for diagnostic analysis.  Also, he may then remove any lesions that he thinks might be cancerous, and that he is able to.\n\nSeveral days after that he will be better equipped with specific information to discuss with you.\n\nVery often, the first TURB is not enough.  A good uro will repeat this procedure in several weeks to be sure that he/she was able to sample all suspicious areas, and to double check others.  Even at excellent urological centers, the second TURB finds things that were missed the first time.\n\nWhere are you located, geographically?  Where are you being seen?\nUnfortunately, many urologists are not experts in bladder cancer treatment.  This is as very treatable disease in most cases, IF the correct treatment is started early.  However, many, many urologists spend their time with prostates and are not really proficient in the nuances of bladder cancer.  One of the major TV networks had a report just a few months ago on the HUGE percentage of bladder cancer patients who do not receive optimal treatment.\n\nTherefore, if at all possible, we ALWAYS recommend a second opinion at a center that has specialists in this area.  After you receive you pathology results, this would be a good time to seek one.

First, your diagnosis is not BAD.  High grade, but obviously non-invasive or the urologist would not have suggested BCG.  I assume that you have do not have one of the relatively rare cancers.  What does your pathology report say?  You should have a copy of this for your records.\n\nSecond, BCG is administered into the bladder via a smaller catheter than your cystoscopy and is only in place for a minute or two.This is done as an office procedure...and then you go home.  BCG is a modified tuberculosis bacterium that was initially developed almost a hundred years ago as a potential anti-tuberculosis vaccination for children. In cases of bladder cancer it is instilled directly into the bladder in the hopes that it will stir up the body's immune system to fight the cancer cells. Yes, it does have side effects since it is intended to stimulate the immune system to reject cancer cells trying to form in the bladder lining.  You will no doubt be uncomfortable for a few hours after administration....urgency, burning, maybe passing some blood clots.  By the following day you should feel almost normal.  For me one of the worst side effects was fatigue which is very common.  The side effects do increase with additional doses, but this is what we WANT to happen;  it indicates that the immune system is kicking in.  If the side effects become too uncomfortable the dose can be reduced significantly and is still effective.  The side effects are minor compared to what patients who receive traditional chemotherapy undergo.\n\nFor high-grade bladder cancer, in the US, the usual regimen is 6 weeks of one treatment per week, then several months off.  This is followed by a \"maintenance\" regimen...usually one dose every week for three weeks for about two years.  This maintenance protocol has been shown to significantly increase the effectiveness of BCG in high grade bladder cancer. This is considered the \"standard of care\" in the US.\n\nBCG can be life-saving in cases of high grade bladder cancer.  I am now almost 11 years out and still clear!!

For males a neobladder can be wonderful (after everything settles down) BUT it is a very complicated surgery with a long recovery time and you absolutely need a surgeon who is very experienced with this.  Otherwise you are just \"practice.\"\n\nRobotic surgery is wonderful, but again it needs to be done by someone with a lot of experience.  Too many surgeons of all types get a demo/training by the company rep and think they are set to go.  I would rather have traditional surgery by a very experienced surgeon than robotic by a novice!!\n\nAnd then there is radiation.  I suppose that this can work, but the reports I have seen from patients who have been through it are not encouraging.

She is very fortunate to have you in her corner.\n\nFirst, her doctor may have a very good idea of what the diagnosis may be, but will not know specifically until the biopsy report is in.  This should tell you  what type of cancer it is (most bladder cancers are \"TCC\" or transitional cell carcinoma, but not all.)  Also whether it is \"high grade\" (rapidly dividing and likely to spread) or \"low grade\" (slow growing.)  The biopsy report should also indicate that muscle tissue...not just the bladder lining tissue...was included in the samples and whether or not the cancer has spread into the muscle and underlying tissue.  Very often, the first TURB (transurethral resection of the bladder) is followed by a second.  During a second biopsy the urologist has a much better idea of what areas need special attention, so do not be surprised if this is suggested.\n\nOnce your friend has a definitive diagnosis, a treatment plan needs to be discussed and decided on.  IF the cancer has not spread into the muscle, but is \"high grade,\" a course of BCG treatments may be suggested.  If that is the case, we can discuss that further with you.  If the cancer has spread into the muscle, the urologist may recommend bladder removal (cystectomy.)  In many cases this is a complete cure, and there are many people here on the Forum leading full lives without their original bladder.  Again, IF it comes to that, there are many here who can discuss this with you.\n\nFirst, get the results of the biopsy (and get a COPY of the path report.)

I worked in the research\ngrant area at NIH for a number of years in my deep dark past and just have to\nmake some comments.\n\n\nThe article is right-on in many ways.  BUT if it were only so easy to identify truly\ninnovative research.  90% of research scientists will insist that their proposals are\ntruly innovative, ground breaking, absolutely necessary.  And, as you can imagine,\nmost are not.  It is relatively easy to identify many that are mundane, and several\nmentioned in the article are very typical of that kind.\n\n\nImagine that you are reviewing 200 grant proposals for a limited pot of money as a\nscientist working on a review panel for NIH.  About 10% can be disapproved off the\nbat because they are so flawed that there is no chance of a meaningful result, even\nif the money is awarded.  About half are not \"fatally flawed\" but do not show innovation\nor promise of anything new or especially significant.  These are approved, but with low\npriority and are unlikely to meet the funding area.\n\n\nNow you are faced with a still large number of grant applications which show some\npromise....many more than the available funds will support.  Some of these are continuations\nof work that has been supported and are showing some results.  Some are proposals\nof new research efforts that follow along expected lines, that will probably have some success\nand which will add significantly to what we already know.  Then there are a few (more than\nthe money available) which are \"far out.\"... IF they worked it would really be exciting (!!!) but\nwith absolutely no evidence that the idea would work out.  Here is where reviewers truly\nagonize and wish that SOMEHOW there was some preliminary data that indicates that at\nleast all the experimental animals wouldn't die in the first week!!!\n\n\nOK.  You now have a group of applications that you would love to see funded...and only enough\nmoney for 25% (in a good year) of these.  Do you a.  continue funding ongoing research which\nis closer to finding results?  b.  recommend funding for new projects along lines that have been\nsuccessful in the past?  c.  provide money to a project which COULD be truly innovative/exciting\nbut which the odds say is a real gamble?   Remember that option \"c\" would mean closing down\nthe projects in a. or not starting b.  This would probably mean that the scientist with a. would end\nup letting a number of his/her technicians and graduate students go.\n\n\nIt ain't easy making these decisions.  Articles such as this one in the NYT seem to lead us to think\nthat selecting \"breakthrough\" projects is routine.  Just think of the number of treatments for cancer that have not panned out, although hopes were high at the beginning.  If we could just have known\nfrom the start which would have worked and which wouldn't, think of the money, time, lives that\ncould have been saved.\n\n\nAnd the answer is not always to throw more money into the pot.  Yes, more money does mean more\nresearch...but until the science is there all the money in the world won't cure us.  It will just fund more\nmundane, routine stuff.  Perhaps the best idea, as mentioned in the article, is a limited amount of\nmoney set aside for risky ideas.\n\n\nSorry for the length, but need to \"vent\" a bit\t\t\t", "date": "2009-06-28T22:42:39+00:00", "topic": "Are the right research projects being funded?", "subforum": "31-articles-of-interest"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tI agree with ALL the above.

A \"high grade\" tumor is one in which the cells are rapidly dividing and this type is especially dangerous since they are much more likely to spread (metastasize) than \"low grade\" tumors.\n\n\"Stage\" (0, 3, 4 etc) refers to how much the cancer has already spread.  A stage 0, for example, is still completely localized in the original site;  stage 4 is one that has metastasized and spread into the lymph nodes and into other sites of the body away from the original site.\n\nEvery cancer starts as stage 0....the one localized place where something starts to go haywire.  As time goes by, and the cancer grows, it becomes stage 1 and then on.  No tumor \"starts\" as a stage 4.  When someone has a newly diagnosed cancer, and it is stage 4, that cancer has been growing undetected for a long time. It did not just suddenly appear....although it may have just been found, it has been there for quite a while.\n\nNo one can tell you what the future holds based on the size of your initial tumor.  The only thing that might have happened is that there are already other tumors someplace.  I am not saying that to scare you....we all have that possibility.  This is why the doctors do things like CT scans and many other tests so that that can do their best to detect such possibilities early.\n\nYou may be confusing the fact that bladder cancer has the nasty habit of coming back...ie, new tumors showing up in the bladder after some have been removed, with metasteses where the original tumor has already spread.\n\nRight now, all you can say, is that you HAD bladder cancer tumors and that they were removed.

It was held at our headquarters, in Dalton, Mass, which is also home base for Cynthia and Ed Kinsella, our founders.  After recovering from three exhausting days, I felt that I had some thoughts that need to be shared with all of you.\n\nWe spent quite a bit of time and effort clarifying our Mission Statement and you will see the results of this discussion on the Home Page soon.  But what struck me is the difference between our mission and that of many very worthwhile cancer societies.  Our mission is to offer support and information to the newly diagnosed as well as survivors and to provide a place where we offer this to each other.  Yes, we DO encourage research into the causes, treatments, and eventually a CURE for bladder cancer.  But with our limited resources we need to focus on what we feel we can do best .....and that focus is on survivors!\n\nWe are an entirely VOLUNTEER organization.  Ed Kinsella has recently retired and he and Cynthia spend almost full time on this effort.  Two of the Board members are still working full-time in addition to taking on Society duties.\n\nI have been told that the Internet is free!!! Yes, it is....but web sites and their maintenance are NOT.  In addition, the Society has daily expenses including telephone and mailings....you would be amazed, and gratified, by the number of requests for information that our office (i.e Cynthia) handles.\n\nWe are preparing for an update of our web site.  The cyber world is changing so rapidly that what was \"state of the art\" two or three years ago is sadly behind the times today.  We will be increasing the ease of function and accessibility as well as adding new features.  NONE OF THIS IS FREE.\n\nYou all couldn't come to Dalton, Mass, to join with us last weekend.  (Nor would you have fit into our small office or into the Kinsella's kitchen....where our meetings were held.)  BUT you can still participate, as you do, in supporting the posters to our Forum with good advice and sharing of experiences.  And you can all help us by making a tax deductible  financial contribution!  It needn't be large  (lots of small donations do add up) but it would help support our efforts and let us know that you, too, are with us in this endeavor!\n\nThe easiest way to make a tax deductible contribution is just to click on the DONATE NOW button to the right of this page.  Or, send your contribution to\n\nAmerican Bladder Cancer Society, Inc.\n399 Main Street - Suite 2B\nDalton, MA 01226-1603\n\nThanks for listening!!\n\nSara Anne\t\t\t", "date": "2014-08-07T20:38:18+00:00", "topic": "TO ALL OUR MEMBERS", "subforum": "17-chit-chat"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tCONGRATULATIONS TO DOUG AND ANITA!!!

It appears to be a heterogeneious diagnosis, since some people go for years with no symptoms except for really wierd blood counts before symptoms start to show up...fatigue, anemia, night sweats, swollen lymph nodes.  On the other hand, some patients are diagnosed and go down hill rapidly.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health is doing a study on the natural history of the disease in untreated (ie, watch and wait, or watch and worry) patients, and we applied for Al to participate almost two years ago.  We finally were invited to come to Bethesday, and we returned yesterday.  Thought some of you might be interested in how such things work, so I am copying below my report to the ACOR-CLL list.\n__________________________________________________\n\n\nFINALLY, after over a year's wait, I accompanied my friend, Al, to NIH to be screened for\nthe CLL natural history study.  (For those who are still waiting, or who would like to be included,\nwe learned that they currently have about 150 enrolled, hope to get to at least 250, and probably\n500 before the study is closed.)\nThe principal investigators we met were\nAdrian Wiestner, MD, PhD of the NHLBI Hematology Branch and\nGerald Marti, MD, PhD, Cellular and Tissue Therapy Branch, Division of Cellular and Gene Therapies, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), FDA\nDr. Marti's area of expertise is in the development of technology for such things as flow cytometry for cellular anaylsis.\nThe study was transferred from the Cancer Institute to the Heart Institute Hematology Branch about a year ago since Dr. Wiestner is the\none with the real interest in CLL.\n\nAl has been in watch-and-wait for about ten years.  We wondered if they would find him \"exciting\" enough to include in the study.\nThe research nurse, Susan Soto, assured us that they would not have invited him if they did not think he would meet their criteria (big sigh of relief.)\nThis visit was primarily a repeat of all his blood work, a physical exam, and a consultation with the investigators.  They concurred that he has been getting\nexcellent care from his local hem/onco.  However, his local doc has been toying with the idea of at least putting him on prednisone (which Al has declined)\nand the NIHers concurred that he should not do this, at this point.  They did find enlarged lymph nodes (which they are itching to get their hands on).\n\nHe will go back to NIH in April for a CT scan and assignment to at least one study they have him in mind for.\n\nIt was most impressive to be packed into one small exam room with the principal investigators, the research nurse, and two fellows and realize\nall the expertise surrounding us.  They do emphasize that they are doing research, not \"treating\" you.  However, if anything in your condition changes\nthey will be ready to make additional recommendations for treatment, or put you into an appropriate therapeutic trial at NIH.\n\nA few negatives....this first visit is totally at our expense.  We understood that he would be reimbursed for the next trip, in April....however this is only half\ncorrect.  He will not be formally enrolled in the study until the morning of his arrival at NIH, so half of his airfare will be on us.  The reimbursement for a hotel\nis $60 per night.  I DARE you to find a convenient hotel in Bethesda for anything near that, even with their \"clinical patient\" rate.  Still, it is worth it for the\nquality of the evaluations and the ability to contribute to the knowledge base on CLL.\n\nSome totally extraneous thoughts....I used to  work at NIH, but haven't been back to Bethesda for about 25 years.  In the meantime they have constructed the\nmetro (very easy to get from Reagan National Airport to Bethesda!) and COMPLETELY redone downtown Bethesda.  As we got off the Metro and started to\nwalk to our hotel, I couldn't even recognize the street we were on and had to ask for directions!!  Embarrassing!!  The NIH campus also had some drastic changes.\nIt looks like a university campus...lots of buildings all over, lots of grass and lovely trees.  You used to be able to walk in, wander around, eat in the cafeterias or picnic.\nNot any more.  Since 9/11 all government facilities have really upped security.  The entire campus is surrounded by a high metal fence.  Only two entrances are\nopen to the public.  NIH furnishes shuttle transportation from local hotels and airports to the Clinical Center.  Our bus stopped at the Patient Entrance.  We got\noff and basically went through a screening exactly like TSA airport screening and were issued an ID badge to wear.  Then back on the bus which delivered us to\nthe Clinical Center.  It is sad that the world has come to this.\n\nSara Anne\t\t\t", "date": "2010-09-17T20:24:33+00:00", "topic": "Visit to NIH", "subforum": "17-chit-chat"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tMike, I am genuinely shocked at you.

Today someone wrote in with a problem and no one has replied to her yet.  Can anyone give me advice as to a reply?  Did she \"abandon\" her primary doc when she accepted treatment from an expert?\n__________\n\"Hello,\nAs a result of a CT scan because of a kidney stone, a spot was found on my liver. An MRI followed by a liver biopsy revealed that the spot was an accumulation of lymphocytic cells.  The spot does cause me some discomfort and according to my Dr. is the cause of the pain in my right arm.  At the time, my local onc suggested that I be treated with Bendamustine. He did not give me any other options and I was not comfortable with that option based on my research.  For that reason,I went to see Dr. Keating.\n\nDr. Keating recommended a round of treatment using Ritxuan.  I had 4 infusions and the result is that my WBC is now in the normal range. Dr. Keating said the Rituxan would also take care of the issue with my liver.  However, 5 months later, based on an MRI, the spot on my liver has gotten bigger.\n\nWhen I asked my local onc for his opinion relative to what I should do, he would not give me an opinion.  He indicated that because I had gone to see Dr. Keating and taken his recommendation, he did not feel he was my primary doctor and therefore was not comfortable giving me an opinion.  He said he would write a letter to Dr. Keating with his findings including the results of a liver panel test and that I should call Dr. Keating to see what he wanted me to do.\n\nI kept probing but he would not give me his opinion. He ended by saying that he would do whatever I wanted him to do and that there were treatment options but that I needed to get those from Dr. Keating.\n\nHave any of you encountered this type of problem?  I really like my onc but am so disappointed by his reaction. He is kind and compassionate and I really don't want to change doctors.  I would welcome any feedback.\"\n_____________\nThanks for your opinions..\n\nSara Anne\t\t\t", "date": "2009-11-02T23:14:50+00:00", "topic": "Second opinion help for someone with anothercancer", "subforum": "17-chit-chat"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tWell Julie...I see that the chile rellanos turned you on your head!!\n\nSara Anne\t\t\t", "date": "2009-10-15T06:48:13+00:00", "topic": "I met Anita", "subforum": "17-chit-chat"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tExcellent work, Charlotte and Mike!

The masks were ubiquitous due to the swine flue panic.  First noticed it in the SF airport where all Japanese were wearing them.  We had to wait on the plane for about 30 min at Arita for the public health officials to check the plane out.  First we filled out a questionnaire about our recent health.  Then a huge team of people in surgical gowns, vented masks, and goggles entered the plane...they looked surreal.  They had a camera-like device that picked up heat and looked at everyone through it.  In our section (the very back) of the plane they identified two people in the middle seats for further examination.  My friend and I were sitting by the windows so they let us go, but the people within 12 rows of the two \"suspects\" were temporarily held until the \"suspects\" were clared;  otherwise they would have been held for 10 days!  We were given masks when we left the plane and had to wear them until we passed ANOTHER health check before passport control.\nIn Japan saw lots of masks and some people covered their noses when they passed us, Americans who might infect them!\t\t\t", "date": "2009-05-18T15:22:56+00:00", "topic": "I\\'m back!!!", "subforum": "17-chit-chat"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tADDENDUM:\n\nwww.totousa.com/Default.aspx?tabid=110\n\nOne feature I forgot to mention:  the soft, warm air-dry\t\t\t", "date": "2009-05-18T15:22:56+00:00", "topic": "I\\'m back!!!", "subforum": "17-chit-chat"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tYou all noticed I was gone, right? \n\nJust returned from a two-week trip to Japan.
