I can tell you the past 2 years of have not been good for me at all.  About the time my back began to feel a bit better, we found this nasty thing in my bladder.  In March of this year I had my TURB, followed by 6 weeks of BCG, then two 3 week maintenance treatments which finally ended Oct 21.  Since initiating the BCG, I have experienced severe sciatica with pain down my leg, an very painful arthritic shoulder and swollen joints in my hands all during the time of treatment over the past 7 months.  I have had my pain mgmt. Doc prescribe a neurological medicine to trick my brain into thinking there was no pain.  But because of all the side effects I stopped taking that foul medicine a week ago.  My wife told me I looked and moved like I was 85 yrs. old....and I felt even older than that.  I couldn't do anything around the ol' motorhome without needing a couple days in bed to recover from all the back pain.  Last week an ortho. surgeon told me he couldn't offer me anything to improve my back/sciatica pain.  Really? I was wondering how I would spend the rest of my life with these conditions. \n\nOn Monday I woke up feeling \"different\" and as I moved about I began to wonder what happened to the chronic pain down my leg and in my back?  As I went through the day only a little pain returned, probably mostly due to fatigue.  On Tuesday things improved even more and have done so each succeeding day.  I can tell you I feel like I'm 10 yrs younger today than, say a week ago and have maybe only 5% of the pain I used to experience....certainly something very livable.  My shoulder feels much improved and as I type this my fingers feel back to their normal selves with no swelling or tightness in the joints. \n\nSo what happened?  I don't know for sure.  But I didn't go to one of those faith healer guys in a circus tent or anything like that.  I have been off the BCG about 4 weeks now and I honestly believe that is the only thing I can attribute this to.\n\nSo what does this all mean?  I would say to those who have experienced the arthritic effects we've been discussing here lately....just hang in there because better days must be ahead, if my experience is any indication.  I'm not saying everyone will experience what I have, but I wish each of you as much of a return to \"normal\" as possible after you get through your BCG treatments.
