That was one of my biggest concerns.  I think I had a different perspective because I was at the very end of my time with my mother who died a couple of months later from cancer.  My worry about people treating me like an invalid kept me from sharing with people for a while.\n\nI have shared this in stages.  My immediate family was all very different and I have followed their lead about how much we talk about this.\n\nWork has been more difficult.  Teaching 7th graders, I know I don't want them to know so I slowly shared this one on one with people at work.\n\nI have been amazed at the support I have and know that it is the ability to share things with others that are dealing with the same that has given me the knowledge needed to have the strength to deal.\n\nAgain, I was lucky to find this site and it is good to know that I have people to ask when I am dealing with anything.\t\t\t", "date": "2010-09-02T13:50:52+00:00", "topic": "How to tell others....one person\\'s method.", "subforum": "3-newly-diagnosed"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tTime magazine had a great article in the January 2010 issue that talked about our \"Epigenetics\"\n\nIt talked about the fact that we may not do anything to develop a cancer, but our parents may have and therefore passed that down to us in our genes.\n\nWhen I read the post from Pemquid and her father, it made me think of the article and I will need to pull that back out again.\n\nTitle is:  Why genes aren't destiny.

My husband has T1G3+ CIS.  We live in northern California.  He has accepted the fact that he needs to have a neo-bladder performed.  He did have a consult with Dr. Konety at UCSF who has great experience with the robotic approach.  We live 2 hours away from UCSF and would need to establish with a PCP ect. to get this done there.  We are very close to UCDMC and have a very good surgeon Dr. Chris Evans there who is able to perform the surgery but not robotically.  This is very close to our home and follow up care would be a breeze.  Is the advantage that great having this surgery via DaVinci? I want the very best for him and will overcome the odds to get it done outside our community but I have several advantages having it done at UCDMC.  One of the greatest is I am an employee and they do care for their own.  Opinions or thoughts?  We need to make a decision by Friday so I can change our medical group.  Thank you\t\t\t", "date": "2009-05-13T21:23:28+00:00", "topic": "What to do?

This will lose some time but might be better in the end.  So - for those who did travel for their surgery - can you share with me what to expect?  If I allow 12 days for the surgery and hospitalization - is it best to get a apartment or hotel for 3-4 weeks?  Is the patient usually discharged with a catheter?  Is the first follow up appointment within days of hospital discharge and therefore better to stay in the city of surgery facility?  If his PET scan was clear last month do I have a month to get this all arranged or am I in danger of jeopardizing his health?  If I change his care today to a San Francisco medical group the soonest we can be seen would be early June and then back to Konety and then....  what is the average time  before surgery takes place?  As you can tell I am about as frazzled as I get and need to make a decision that is well informed and doesn't create more stress.  Thank you all for helping me.
