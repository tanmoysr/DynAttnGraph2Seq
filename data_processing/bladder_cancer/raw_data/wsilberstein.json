A TURB cannot be done through a flexible scope and definitely requires anesthesia. If you are too ill for general anesthesia perhaps you can  have it done with spinal anesthesia or an epidural.

Any further dilations or urethrotomies are not advisable. It is entirely possible that the increasing difficulty I'm havng wtih the stricture is due to the multiple dilations I've had to accomplish cystoscopies. The next step is a urethral reconstruction. The urologist believes the stricture is short enough to remove the scar tissue and do an end to end anastamosis. This will be done through a perineal incision. If the stricture is longer than it appears on the retrograde urethrogram, then it will require a graft using buccal mucosa.\t\t\t", "date": "2009-03-15T05:08:30+00:00", "topic": "Urethral stricture decsion Part 2", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tI never had BCG.

What would be a physician's motivation to hide something? The medical profession's ultimate goal is to successfully treat patients. I can't see how hiding the truth from patients would accomplish that. And the suggestion that the medical community as a whole is hiding something smacks of some sinister conspiracy with an ulterior motive. I'm sure that's not really what you were thinking.\nAs for myself, I'm TaG3 plus CIS, 7\u00be years cancer free without a recurrence. Was it my surgeon's skill, the Mitomycin C treatments, or just good luck? I don't know. And although I've had complications of the Mitomycin C (a urethral stricture) I would still opt for treatment if I had to make the choice over again.\t\t\t", "date": "2008-08-02T06:34:12+00:00", "topic": "Update on white patches", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tWhen I was first diagnosed TaG3 + CIS 7\u00be years ago, I didn't know about this site, and I found all kinds of information on the net that frightened me - reliable information too, because as a physician I have access to medical web sites, but the information was dry and lacked perspective.

I'm hypersensitive about going as soon as I feel the urge because of the worry that holding it may have been what caused the Bladder Cancer to begin with (?)Dear Rose,\nVoiding infrequently increases the risk of UTI because it allows bacteria that have entered the bladder to take a foothold rather than be washed out, but I have never heard that there is any reason ignoring an urge could cause bladder cancer, and it doesn't make sense to me as an hypothesis. Ignoring an urge doesn't make a great deal of sense either since there's no reason to be uncomfortable, but the point at which an urge becomes urgent does vary. Case example: when my urethral stricture was inflamed, it made my bladder irritable, but urinating caused so much pain and aggravated the situation so that I did learn to ignore the urge to a point.\nIt is possible that anxiety about the urge has you going the minute you have a bladder sensation. You might make an effort to retrain yourself, but focusing on it might make you have to go more. And frankly, unless the urge is there, it can't wake you from your sleep. On the other hand, if your sleep is disturbed for another reason, you might then find it hard to get back to sleep without going. The answer there is to deal with what's disturbing your sleep.\nThirst is another matter which is individual. Good bladder health demands adequate fluid intake, but you might be drinking more than you need by habit. If you drink more slowly, and your drink is good and cold, it may quench your thirst with less. It might also help to swish the first few sips around your mouth to wet the entire membrane.\nRegarding Vesicare: I've never taken it, but I've taken Detrol, and it definitiely constipates me. When I have to take it, I take Senokot prophylactically. That's probably not desirable for long-term management, but if you have to be on Vesicare long-term you might do well with a fiber supplement and a stool softener or Miralax and an occasional Senokot to move things along. The thing is that Vesicare is for overactive bladder - bladder spasms. If you gotta go because your bladder is full, an antispamotic is not the answer and won't eliminate the urge.

You need the EOB (explanation of benefits) that your provider received from your insurance company. It shows what they charged, what the allowable charges are, what they were paid, and the disposition of any unpaid charges. The EOB might even show that according to the doctors' contract, they are not allowed to balance bill you, in which case you are entitiled to a full refund. If you were charged a deductible, or a service was rejected, there will be an explanation. All of this will help you figure out if there was a correctable error which can eliminate the charge to you. The doctor's office should be able to provide you with a copy of the EOB, but so should your insurance company.

I've been having these strange symptoms which are driving me nuts. It all started off with frequence urination. My GP sent me to a nephrologist who did blood work and an ultrasound. The blood work showed I had a UTI and the scan was negative. He gave me medication and sent me off. My symptoms never stopped and I tested positive again for a UTI.\nNow I've been sent to a urologist who has me scheduled for another ultrasound and my tests were negative.\nBasically I have severe pain and difficulty urinating in the morning. I have lower abdominal bloating and pain. It seems like my bladder is never empty. The strangest symptom of all is that I DO NOT HAVE URINARY URGENCY. I can go HOURS without feeling the need to pee and when I do every little comes out.\nCould I have bladder cancer eventhough the ultrasound and urine\\blood tests were negative? I am 19.Hey John,\n&#160; &#160; &#160;  There are so many things that can cause urinary symptoms, and at 19, bladder cancer is a highly unlikley possibility. But I do find some things confusing in your story.\n\nFirst, a UTI cannot be diagnosed or ruled out by a blood test or dipstick urinalysis. The only reliable test to diagnose or rule out UTI is a urine culture. A culture is especially important with persistent symptoms because the organism and its sensitivity to antibiotics can be determined to help determine the best choice of antibiotics. If symptoms persist on antibiotics a culture tells you if there's a need to change. If symtpoms recur, a culture tells you if it's the same organism. A negative culture tells the doctor if the treatment worked. A blood test would be the least reliable way to diagnose UTI because bladder infections rarely affect the blood work, and abnormal blood work doesn't tell you where an infection is. Kidney infections are more likely to affect the blood work, but generally cause fever and flank pain.\nSecond, healthy 19 year old men don't get UTIs. Well, I'll never say never - but if any young male patient of mine truly had a UTI, I would feel it absolutely essential to do a thorough evaluation of his urinary tract to find out why. An ultrasound is a fine start. In fact, an ultrasound is an excellent way to find out if you do fully empty your bladder. Was that checked? If these symptoms don't clear up, and if you really are having recurrent infection you probably should have a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) to make sure you don't have bladder reflux into your kidneys (although such problems usually show up as UTIs in infancy) and maybe even a cystoscopy to look at the bladder.\nIf this is not really infection related, there are lots of other tests a urologist can do to evaluate voiding problems to see if they can find a cause... and I'm not talking about serious things for you to worry about. I'm talking about finding answers to help you.\nThird, I have to ask (and you need not feel obligated to answer except to yourself), Any possibility you could have an STD? Have you been checked?\nFourth, I have to ask about your bowel habits (and again, I'm asking for you benefit. You don't have to answer). The bladder sits against the rectum. Since you mention lower abdominal pain and bloating, maybe there's a connection. I've had a few little boys evaluated by the pediatric urologist for things like penile pain and voiding problems who turned out to have constipation as the cause for their symptoms.\n\nLet me just say that cancer is the most frightening possibility, so I understand why you're concerned about it, and you're wise not to ignore the possibility even though it is most unlikley. But UTI is also an unlikley possibility unless it is proven to be the diagnosis by culture - and it really drive me nuts when my colleagues jump on the easy diagnosis when it doesn't make sense. Forgive my rant if you were correctly diagnosed with UTI and I somehow missed it. The bottom line is that you need your doctor or urologist to be willing to spend the time with you and sort this out rather than doing a quick test and sending you on your way with a prescription. You deserve an answer and hopefully a solution even if the problem isn't something serious like cancer.\t\t\t", "date": "2007-09-20T08:28:55+00:00", "topic": "Really scared...Need advice badly...please help", "subforum": "8-non-invasive-superficial-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\nall one needs to do is check out the metastatic area to find dilligent patients and not so dilligent uro's who felt the naked eye was all they needed to access the grade of tumor/tumors.I can't help but be amused.

I'm not sure how the Cunningham clamp differs from the j-clamp. I use the j-clamp when I get out of the shower and when I transition between devices. After 1.5 hours I start to have intense penile pain, and I leak even with the clamp set on the highest setting after I've been wearing it for a while.

As with all the devices, I have to change positions slowly to avoid yanking my penis out of the device.\nDuring the night I use the GeeWhiz, a condom catheter that attaches to the penis with a silicon strip and tape over the condom. Although I think I've mastered applying it so that it's unlikely to detach,  reapplying it is not so easy that I would chance using it at work. I have an overnight bag and long tubing. The AFEX wouldn't be  good for night sine it doesn't seal with the body, although I find mine does form a suction. In any event, I find all the devices become irritating after a while, so that switching from one to another gives the sore spots a break, since each device irritates in a different manner.\nI've also switched off to the McGuire type device, but it holds too little to be practical and the outlet is a screw cap which guarantees it will get lost and you'll get pee on your hands. It comes with a leg bag, but the tubing is too short to put it down on the calf.

I'm a pediatrician, diagnosed with TCC TaG3 + CIS 12 years ago. I was treated by TURB & intravesical mitomycin C. I developed a major problem with a urethral stricture which is when I learned about this support group and became a member. In 10/2009 I finally had a urethroplasty to repair the stricture just in time to deal with a recurrence of CIS after 10 years cancer-free. I was treated with BCG, and 1 year later had a recurrence of CIS treated with BCG/interferon. I had consulted specialists at Weill-Cornell and NYU, who agreed that this was a reasonable approach and that a recurrence after that would require a cystectomy. 6-7 months after my last set of biopsies and 3 months after BCG/interferon my biopsy shows high grade TCC with invasion of the lamina propria making it T1G3. My opinion is that this is a rapid enough progression to make it wise to get this bladder out before it becomes muscle invasive, even though it is not a recurrence of CIS (which I'm betting would happen within the year anyway). I have forwarded the biopsy reports to the specialist at NYU.

I'm back. It's been about a year. For those of you who don't know me, I had high grade noninvasive cancer (TaG3) plus CIS in 12/2000. My urologist treated with mitomycin C instead of BCG and I remained cancer-free for 10 years. Unfortunately I had complications of treatment - a urethral stricture that caused me no end of grief and finally required a urethral reconstruction in 2009. I've had many follow up cystoscopies and often had areas of redness. Last year when I had an ill defined epididymal mass for which I needed surgery I asked my urologist to biopsy my bladder and I had CIS. Fortunately with my urethra repaired I was able to be treated with BCG, after which my biopsy was negative for cancer. Subsequent to that my urologist continued to see a red area in my bladder, and he agreed with my request that if it persisted for a year we would biopsy it. The results - a recurrence of CIS.\n\nI've already posted this on the non-invasive board but decided to repost on the invasive board because I want to hear from people who've had radical cystectomies.\n\nI have read that delaying cystectomy to preserve the bladder can end up shortening one's life. I have no great love for my bladder as it has caused me a great deal of pain, and since I haven't had an erection since the urethral surgery 2 years ago, I'm certainly not concerned about the sexual side effects of a radical cystectomy.\n\nMy urologist does not think a radical cystectomy is called for and would like to treat me with intravesical valrubicin. I'm tempted, not because I want to keep my bladder, but my partner (I'm a pediatrician) is retiring due to a recurrence of pancreatic cancer leaving me alone to run our practice. I don't see how I can manage being out for 6+ weeks. But then I could have a reaction to the valrubicin... Probably not an issue as far as work since I've gone to work many days in pain over the years.\n\nI told my urologist I need a second opinion and he recommended William Huang at NYU. I also got a referral from the uro who did my urethral reconstruction to Douglas Scherr at Presbyterian/Weill Cornell. Seeing both of them this month.\n\nSo, now I'd like you all to cast your votes and voice your opinions as to my next step.\n\nI'd also like to know what to expect if I have the radical cystectomy - length of hospitalization, recovery period before returning to work, dealing with continence issues, complications any of you may have had.\n\n-Warren\t\t\t", "date": "2012-05-06T15:46:30+00:00", "topic": "Radical Cystectomy or More Intravesical Chemo", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tCynthia.

Glad she did. My life is hectic, but good, and I always have time for you folks so please feel free to contact me if you think I can help.\nAnyway, my first comment is more of a question. What really was going on with your father's right kidney? Nephrosis has so many possible meanings all I really know is that there was something wrong with his kidney. In kids, nephrosis generally refers to the results of inflammation of the kidney, and neither nephrostomies nor stents get involved with the treatment. Perhaps a clearer understanding of what's going on with your father's right kidney might lead to an explanation about the bigger picture and help to understand what's happening to his left kidney.\nSecond, is the left kidney obstructed, or not producing urine? That's a crucial question, and not one that has weeks to figure out. There are nuclear scans, ultrasounds, and CT scans which should clarify that answer. If the kidney has somehow become obstructed due to what they've done, they need to fix that ASAP. If the left kidney isn't producing urine they need to know if the blood supply to his kidney was affected or if the kidney is failing.\nMaybe it's something as simple as the right kidney, once opened up, has not recovered enough to concentrate the urine properly and is overproducing urine so that the left kidney is doing what a well behaving kidney should do and compensating by producing less. But it's still important to know that the left is functioning and not miss an opporunity to fix something that can't wait.\nI can't promise to monitor this thread, so please PM me if I should follow this discussion further.\t\t\t", "date": "2008-06-06T04:13:16+00:00", "topic": "Kidney Not Producing Urine", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\t     I wasn't quite sure if I should respond to this because I do sympathize with your plight, but then I thought, perhaps the group should hear a response from a physician. True, I never got $172 for a visit unless it included immunizations and procedures, but I'm curious just how much everyone thinks a doctor's time is worth. You did say he spent almost 30 minutes. Don't forget, the $172 doesn't all go into his pocket since he has to pay for office staff, supplies and equipment.\nMany of my patients who complain about a $25 copay think nothing about spending $300 at the veterinarian for their pet, big bucks for home and auto repair.\nYou're absolutely right that we need universal health care insurance. I felt that way when Bill Clinton ran for president. I can certainly say that we're not better off with the HMOs that came in instead. In 1993 my practice lost 1/3 of it's patients because we weren't participating in any HMOs. We had no choice. Their contracts require that we take a reduced fee. Of course I sympathize with those who don't have insurance and have given many a break to those in need, but does that mean that I should give everyone a break just because I have been forced by the HMOs to accept less from them. You would be amazed by what the HMOs get away with. If a claim isn't filed within 90 days, they don't have to pay it, but if they determine that a patient wasn't insured when they paid a bill, they can take the money back from me 2 years later when I have no recourse. If I see a patient and provide a legitimate & necessary service, and it turns out that they had been assigned to another doctor, the insurance company doesn't have to pay me and I can't bill the patient. Can you imagine the amount of time and expense I have just to provide the care to insured patients!?!\nI haven't raised my rates since 1993 because I won't get paid more no matter what I charge. I'm lucky if I get $40-50 for a visit plus cost for vaccines. My personal expenses have gone up. The cost of running my practice has gone up. And now NYS wants to increase my malpractice insurance by 33% plus a $100,000 annual surcharge for the next 5 years even though I've never been sued.\nThere are lots of poor people who would love to earn what I earn, but I still earn less than I did in 1993. I'm not getting rich. I have to pay for my own retirement and health insurance. I sympathize with the poor and would love for everyone to have a great life, but tell me, after I spent all those years in school and, took out loans, delayed earning a regular income until my education was complete, now that I work holidays and weekends and get calls all hours of the night from sick or frightened patients, even though I recognize that everyone needs affordable health care - do you really want me to earn less for what I provide than your auto mechanic and plumber?\t\t\t", "date": "2008-01-16T04:41:48+00:00", "topic": "Insurance vs. no Insurance", "subforum": "5-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-questions-and-comments"}, {"text": "\nYou may want to find out if the Staph is the MRSA variety (methacillin resistant Staphlococcus Aureus) that is being discussed in the news lately.

When I started having increased twinges and asked him how we'd know if everything was okay since I always had the hematuria he said do a cytology, and when that showed sheets of atypical cells he said it was okay. If I hadn't urinated a clot a month later, I'd either be dead or among the members on this board who had an RC and maybe even chemo. He told me that he learned from my case that he'd have to be more aggressive in evaluating perisitent hematuria - Thank you very much!\t\t\t", "date": "2007-09-11T01:31:49+00:00", "topic": "Chemo Update", "subforum": "7-metastatic-bladder-cancer"}, {"text": "\nMy gynocologist does not know why I'm having pelvic pain, constipation and urine blockage.Dear Rosemary,\nI must have missed this when you originaly posted.

I wasted no time getting my bladder out before I developed invasive disease.\nThat being said, there's no indication that you have bladder cancer, but I had problems with kidney stones during all my treatments, so the best thing to do is follow up appropriately with the cystoscopy.\nI hope by now you've had it done and it was negative for cancer.\t\t\t", "date": "2014-01-31T01:36:49+00:00", "topic": "Would Like Some Suggestions Please", "subforum": "6-men-and-bladder-cancer"}, {"text": "\n\t\t\t\tDear Ian,\nWhile i can assure you from my personal experience that a urethral stricture is no fun, we can manage with it - you and me.

Right now you most likely have swelling at the urethral opening from their mangling it with whatever they did, but if the injury is primarily at the tip, hopefuly they can make sure it heals without a stricture, or monitor it easily enough and open it.\t\t\t", "date": "2008-03-27T21:24:41+00:00", "topic": false, "subforum": "6-men-and-bladder-cancer"}, {"text": "\nFor five cancers -- thyroid, prostate, kidney and breast cancer, and melanoma -- data from the past 30 years show an increasing number of new cases but not an increase in deaths.

My twin and I are celebrating our 60th birthday in July and combining that into a big bash including my other daughter's 30th birthday, and his grand daughter's first birthday. I have lots of cookies to bake. And then back to the engagement - there's a party for that this summer.\nMeanwhile, my wife's mother died after a long battle with metastatic breast cancer on my son's 34th birthday while he was visiting us to celebrate. At least we all got to say good-bye. I wish I could say that my wife enjoyed a close loving relationship with her mother and a friendship as adults like I had with my mother, but it wasn't so - and that makes the healing so much more difficult. Meanwhile, I have been left dealing with my step-father-in-law's affairs because he is old, disabled, and has early dementia, and because my mother-in-law successfully alientated his own family from him.\nI look at the messages on the board to see if anyone would benefit from my input, and while I see lots of people providing the wonderful support you all provide for each other, I find my mind is elsewhere and I have little to offer.\nShould anyone want to talk to me or think someone needs my input, you can PM me and I will get the e-mail calling me to action.
